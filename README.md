# Experimenting Reasoning on SLMs

This is a study project for Humboldt University of Berlin focused on experimenting with reasoning capabilities in small language models (SLMs).

## Project Structure

- `models/reasoning_methods/experiment_gsm8k_prompting.py`: Main script for running experiments.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Experimenting_Reasoning_on_SLMs.git
   cd Experimenting_Reasoning_on_SLMs
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the necessary Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Experiment:**

   Execute the main script to start the experiment:

   ```bash
   python models/reasoning_methods/experiment_gsm8k_prompting.py
   ```

   This script processes examples and evaluates the reasoning capabilities of the model.

## Usage

- Modify the script `experiment_gsm8k_prompting.py` to adjust parameters or experiment with different models.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed as specified in `requirements.txt`.
