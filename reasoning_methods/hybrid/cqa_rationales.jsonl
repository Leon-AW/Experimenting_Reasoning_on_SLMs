To maintain his calorie count, John thought that he should have less what?\nAnswer Choices:\n(A) throw up\n(B) food\n(C) coffee\n(D) stumble\n(E) food\nA:\nJohn's calorie count was 2000 calories. The drink was very sweet. So, the drink would add 200 calories to John's daily calorie count. Now, John's calorie count is 2000 calories. He should not add 200 calories to his daily calorie count. So, he should have less than 2000 calories. Now, I need to find the answer that has 2000 calories. So, I will do a simple math:\n2000 calories - 200 calories = 1900 calories.\nThe answer is food (E).
