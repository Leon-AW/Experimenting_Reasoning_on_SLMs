Input:
27 + 45
Target:
<scratch>
I need to add 27 and 45.
Step 1: Break down the numbers into tens and ones
27 = 20 + 7
45 = 40 + 5
Step 2: Add the tens together
20 + 40 = 60
Step 3: Add the ones together
7 + 5 = 12
Step 4: Combine the results
60 + 12 = 72

Input:
96 - 38
Target:
<scratch>
I need to subtract 38 from 96.
Step 1: Break down the subtraction
96 - 38
Step 2: First subtract the tens
96 - 30 = 66
Step 3: Then subtract the remaining ones
66 - 8 = 58
Step 4: Verify the calculation
96 - 38 = 58

Input:
7 × 8
Target:
<scratch>
I need to multiply 7 by 8.
Step 1: Recall the multiplication fact
7 × 8 = 56
Step 2: Verify by thinking of it as repeated addition
7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 56

56

Input:
144 ÷ 12
Target:
<scratch>
I need to divide 144 by 12.
Step 1: Think about how many times 12 goes into 144
12 × 10 = 120
12 × 12 = 144
Step 2: So 144 ÷ 12 = 12

Input:
15 + 28
Target:
<scratch>
I need to add 15 and 28.
Step 1: Break down into tens and ones
15 = 10 + 5
28 = 20 + 8
Step 2: Add the tens
10 + 20 = 30
Step 3: Add the ones
5 + 8 = 13
Step 4: Combine the results
30 + 13 = 43
</scratch>
43

Input:
63 - 29
Target:
<scratch>
I need to subtract 29 from 63.
Step 1: Use the strategy of subtracting 30 and adding back 1
63 - 30 = 33
Step 2: Add back the extra 1 we subtracted
33 + 1 = 34
Step 3: Verify: 63 - 29 = 34
</scratch>

Input:
9 × 6
Target:
<scratch>
I need to multiply 9 by 6.
Step 1: Use the multiplication fact
9 × 6 = 54
Step 2: Double-check by thinking of it as 6 × 9
6 × 9 = 54
</scratch>
54

Input:
81 ÷ 9
Target:
<scratch>
I need to divide 81 by 9.
Step 1: Think about the multiplication table for 9
9 × 9 = 81
Step 2: Therefore, 81 ÷ 9 = 9
</scratch>
9

Input:
47 + 36
Target:
<scratch>
I need to add 47 and 36.
Step 1: Break into tens and ones
47 = 40 + 7
36 = 30 + 6
Step 2: Add the tens
40 + 30 = 70
Step 3: Add the ones
7 + 6 = 13
Step 4: Combine the results
70 + 13 = 83
</scratch>
83

Input:
100 - 67
Target:
<scratch>
I need to subtract 67 from 100.
Step 1: Set up the subtraction
100 - 67
Step 2: Since 100 is a round number, I can think of it as
100 - 60 - 7 = 40 - 7 = 33
Step 3: Verify: 100 - 67 = 33
</scratch>
33

Input:
125 + 78
Target:
<scratch>
I need to add 125 and 78.
Step 1: Break down the numbers
125 = 100 + 20 + 5
78 = 70 + 8
Step 2: Add the hundreds
100 + 0 = 100
Step 3: Add the tens
20 + 70 = 90
Step 4: Add the ones
5 + 8 = 13
Step 5: Combine all parts
100 + 90 + 13 = 203
</scratch>
203

Input:
84 ÷ 7
Target:
<scratch>
I need to divide 84 by 7.
Step 1: Think about multiples of 7
7 × 10 = 70
7 × 12 = 84
Step 2: Therefore, 84 ÷ 7 = 12
