64,,"Passage: New research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that people who struggle with mood problems or addiction can safely quit smoking and that kicking the habit is associated with improved mental health. 
     Cavazos-Rehg, an assistant professor of psychiatry, found that quitting or significantly cutting back on cigarette smoking was linked to improved mental health outcomes. Quitting altogether or reducing by half the number of cigarettes smoked daily was associated with lower risk for mood disorders like depression, as well as a lower likelihood of alcohol and drug problems.
     ""We don't know if their mental health improves first and then they are more motivated to quit smoking or if quitting smoking leads to an improvement in mental health,"" Cavazos-Rehg said. ""But either way, our findings show a strong link between quitting and a better psychiatric outlook.""
     In addition, she believes the serious health risks associated with smoking make it important for doctors to work with their patients to quit, regardless of other psychiatric problems.
     ""About half of all smokers die from related to smoking, so we need to remember that as complicated as it can be to treat mental health issues, smoking cigarettes also causes very serious illnesses that can lead to death,"" she explained.
     Cavazos-Rehg and her team analyzed questionnaires gathered as part of the National Epidemiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions. In the early 2000s, just under 35,000 people were surveyed. As part of the study, they answered questions about drinking, smoking and mental health in two interviews conducted three years apart.
    The researchers focused on data from 4,800 daily smokers. Those who had addiction or other psychiatric problems at the time of the first survey were less likely to have those same problems three years later if they had quit smoking. And those who hadn't had psychiatric problems at the initial survey were less likely to develop those problems later if they already had quit. 
   ""We really need to spread the word and encourage doctors and patients to tackle these problems,"" Cavazos-Rehg said. ""When a patient is ready to focus on other mental health issues, it may be an ideal time to address smoking cessation, too.""

These months of inactivity--- away from the daily tiring things of school--- are something that young people look forward to, but it can have a detrimental influence on the knowledge they have.
Studies have shown that children lose a lot in math skills during the summer months. Children who spend little time learning experience a much greater amount of learning loss than those who often take part in summer programs.
So when school starts again in the fall, teachers often have to spend several weeks reteaching children material that they have forgotten.
Experts suggest that parents make sure the summer months are a time of continued learning. For example, they suggest that lunch time is good time to improve a child's spoken skills, simply through conversation. A trip to the supermarket can be an opportunity to improve a child's math skills by having him or her add up the cost of food. And there is no better way to prevent learning loss than by having a child read every day.

Dr. Thomas Houston, a professor of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, led a group of scientists that investigated how pre-recorded videos of hypertension   patients' talking about their medical histories helped another group of patients with high blood pressure to control their condition over several months.
   Houston was surprised by their studies that suggested that communication can be a powerful tool in medicine. They showed that those who had had similar experiences, when talking to someone with a similar background, could help change their behavior to become healthier. Hypertension is difficult to control, since it is dependent on diet, exercise and mental state. Medical treatments with drugs, and lifestyle therapies  have been  ly ineffective because people find it hard to follow those medical requirements.
   In the test, his team carefully chose their story-tellers from 230 members of a patients' community with whom they could most easily relate. Next, they divided their study population into two groups. One received three interactive   DVDs containing the tellers' stories of their experiences in living with and treating their hypertension. The other were given educational discs on an unrelated health topic. The study volunteers reported that they had listened to the DVDs, and after three months, those who heard the stories of the hypertensive patients lowered their blood pressure.
  While the study did not  _ how the story-telling influenced the patients' behavior, Houston suspects that watching patients of similar backgrounds who had a similar medical experience helped to motivate them to seek medical help to their hypertension. They found that after six months the difference in blood pressure between those who watched the story-tellers and those who observed the unrelated videos remained, suggesting that the story-telling continued to have an effect.

For the past 10 years, people have been sending Frank Warren postcards and other objects with secrets written on them. He now has a million secrets. ""It's a drawing of a lift. And the secret says: 'I feel guilty when I take lifts for one floor, so I limp when I get out.'"" Frank said.
Ten years ago, Mr. Warren created an art project called PostSecret. People then began to send him postcards, other objects and emails telling their secrets. Every Sunday, he chooses 10 secrets and puts them on the website.
Mr. Warren says he created PostSecret so people could share their secrets in a safe place. ""I was struggling with secrets in my own life. And it was by creating this safe place where others could share their secrets with me, I think that space was something I needed just as much as they did.""
He has published six books full of the secrets people have shared with him. One secret in each book is his. Eric Perry delivers mail for the U.S. Postal Service. He has brought thousands of secrets to Frank's home over the past three years. ""I have a couple of the books that Frank's given me and I've read them all and my family has read them all and it's wild!""
The project itself was once one of Frank's secrets. His wife Jan didn't know exactly what he was doing until the first book was published. The publisher told him that the address was going to be on the book, and he refused. However, the address was there just because of the contract between them. Actually Warren wasn't very happy about that.
Some people tell Frank of their secret desire to kill themselves. So he and the PostSecret community have raised more than $1 million to help prevent suicides .

A) satisfy his curiosity about others' secrets
B) collect more materials for his series of books

The book was adapted by the Hangzhou based Star Dream Factory.
""We don't want to descend to the average children's dramas that are overly eager to please the kids,"" said Huang Qin, director of Star Dream Factory. ""We want to provide something practically useful and mystically entertaining.""
The original book by Chinese children's book writer Zheng Yuanjie focuses on safety tips for kids. With Zheng's usual _ and simplicity, the book avoids sugar-coating reality. Instead, it illustrates the potential dangers in everyday life and provides possible solutions.
Zheng recalled that when he saw his new-born baby in the hospital, the first thought that hit him was to do his utmost to guarantee his son's safety.
""Safety is of the greatest importance to a human being,"" said Zheng. ""If the person is gone, nothing else will matter.""
According to Zheng, there is no preaching or soapboxing in his book. He said that he just wanted to talk and tell the plain truth to the children in an easily understandable way.
This line of thought will be echoed in the theatrical reproduction, said director Guo Yan. She also said that the play will place emphasis on multimedia effects and the interaction with the families.
""Theatre may not ensure the children a path to professional esteem and better jobs in society, but it does have the power to give them strength (at heart),"" said Huang Qin.
Huang also calls for consistent attention to child safety, pointing out the lack of universal education and effective legal channels.
The show is expecting an estimated audience of more than 100,000 people during its domestic tour in the upcoming year.

For the paper, the University of Washington's Brian Serafini and Julie Brines analyzed the most recent years of divorce filings in Washington and drew their conclusion: divorce rises sharply in March and August. The result is supported by some nation-wide, anecdotal evidence. Online searches for ""divorce"" and ""child custody""  dramatically grow early in the year, peaking in March, they point out.
The authors guess that unhappily married couples schedule their divorce filings around both the winter holidays and Valentine's Day, as well as summer vacations. (More Americans vacation m July than any other month.)
There are a few explanations why people might time their marital dissolutions this way, It might just be too difficult to announce a divorce around family-oriented Christmas time, especially if there are kids involved, so many couples weigh the decision to divorce around the new year and progress from there. February is a period in which couples tend to look around for representation on legal sites. And by March, they're prepared to file for divorce.
But the authors think the more likely reason is that people decide their differences are irreconcilable right after a big trip. It could be that people don't want to ruin a family getaway, or that vacations are so stressful that they drive the already-dissatisfied to divorce. (""I told you to pack your suitcase last night; now we've missed the train!"")
Then there's the ""broken promise"" theory. ""6People are discontent with their marriages, they look at vacation as an opportunity to give it one last shot, and what they were hoping would happen didn't occur,"" explained Brines, an associate professor of sociology.

And he ran with me until I picked up my pace. I found him at the finish line to thank him for the encouragement only to learn he wasn't even supposed to be in the race that day. He was running in place of someone else.

87,,"Passage: When was the last time someone did something unexpectedly nice for you? Not someone you knew, but a total stranger? It's happened to me a few times, but two instances really stand out.
A few years ago, I was dining out with a person who kept going on and on about himself, completely unaware of the fact that I was sitting there in misery . It wasn't his company that disappointed me. I was recovering from a bad grade in my study. I could have collapsed in tears right there at the table.
When we picked up the check, the waitress said, ""Your meal was already paid for."" My friend and I didn't have a clue how it happened. Then I remembered a man coming in out of the corner of my eye. He was dressed in mostly white, sat down at the bar, had a glass of wine, stayed for maybe ten minutes and then left. The waitress said, ""Yes, the gentleman who was in here a while ago paid for you.""
Just last year, I was running a half-marathon. With just 0.1 miles to go, I was out of gas. Runners call it ""hitting the wall""; I thought I couldn't move another muscle. Out of nowhere, a teenager jogged up next to me and said, ""What's your name sweetie? Jennifer? Okay, Jennifer, let's go! Come on! It's just around the corner! You can do it!"". And he ran with me until I picked up my pace. I found him at the finish line to thank him for the encouragement only to learn he wasn't even supposed to be in the race that day. He was running in place of someone else.
I still shake my head when I think of these momentary angels that came to me at my point of need. Do you have any experiences like this?

It was set up by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1653 in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. From the time they got married, they wouldn't be separated. She followed him to wars, advised him on affairs of state, and was loved by his people for her good work. But she died in 1631 during childbirth. The emperor was heart-broken and had the Taj Mahal built as a sign of his love.
It took more than 20 years for the Taj Mahal to be built. Workers were brought in, not only from all over India, but from Central Asia too. A total of 20,000 people worked on the building.
In 1657, Shah Jahan fell ill, and in 1658 his son Aurangzeb, imprisoned   his father and seized power. Shah Jahan stayed in prison until his death in 1666. He was finally buried there with his wife he could never forget.
The Taj Mahal is definitely worth more than a single visit. As it is built with white marble stones, its character changes in different lights. It looks more beautiful at sunrise and sunset. At sunset, for example, the colour of the Taj changes from white to yellow, then to pink. As the moon rises, it turns a silvery white.

Question: For two persons spending a night in one of these hotels, they have to pay at least   _  . 

Options:
A) $111
B) $182
C) $600
D) $636


Choose the correct answer and conclude with 'The answer is: <A/B/C/D>'. 

Answer: ","C
D
C

Explanation: 

A hotel costs $111 per night for a two-person room. 
B) $182
C) $600
D) $636

Each person spends $111, which is the same amount that the hotel charges. 
This means that the hotel has to pay $111 to each person, and there are $2 people in the room. 
So, the hotel has to pay $222. 
This is the price per person for the room. 
Since the hotel charges $111 per person, the hotel has to pay $111 x 2 people for the room. 
So, the hotel has to pay $222 for the room. 
The answer is: $600.

Note: You can use the following formula to calculate the price per person for a hotel: P = (N x C) / D. 
Where P is the price per person, N is the number of people in the room, C is the cost per person, and D is the cost of the room. 
For example, the price per person for the hotel is: (2 x $111) / 2 = $222. 
The hotel has to pay $111 for each person, so the hotel has to pay $222 for the room
B

Explanation: The price of the room is 182 dollars and the price of a single night is 182 dollars. So the price of the room for two persons is 182 dollars x 2 = 364 dollars. 

The answer is B.

Note: The question is not asking for the price of the room for one person, but for the price of the room for two persons.
B

Explanation: 

Total amount to be paid by two persons =  $111 +  $111 = $222

Total amount to be paid by one person =  $222

So, the amount to be paid by two persons =  $222 -  $222 =  $0 

So, the amount to be paid by one person =  $222

So, the amount to be paid by two persons =  $111 +  $111 = $222

So, the amount to be paid by one person =  $111 +  $111 = $222 

So, the amount to be paid by two persons =  $111 +  $111 = $222

So, the amount to be paid by one person =  $111 +  $111 = $222 

So, the amount to be paid by two persons =  $111 +  $111 = $222

So, the amount to be paid by one person =  $111 +  $111 = $222 

So, the amount to be paid by two persons =  $111 +  $111 = $222

So, the amount to be paid by one person =  $111 +  $111 = $222 

So, the amount

The story of David Boone's journey from sleeping on a park bench to one of Harvard's dorm rooms, certainly stands out from the crowd of his peers. 
David, a 17-year-old senior at a MC2 Stem, a high school in Cleveland, Ohio that focuses largely on engineering and science classes with the help of a grant   from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was offered a full-ride scholarship to Harvard in the fall. 
His family life has been complicated for the past few years after gangs and economic hardships resulted in him being separated from his family and forced to look after himself on the streets and park benches in Cleveland. 
Because both his grandmother and mother could not afford to house the teenagers, his siblings split up to stay with various family friends, but because of space issues and his allergies   to the families pets, David was unable to stay. He ended up in the safer neighborhood of Coventry where there was a safer park with fewer dangers. 
""All of these life lessons have shaped me into who I am, transforming my dreams and aspirations and allowing me to free myself from what was becoming an unproductive environment,"" he wrote in his blog post.
David's thirst for knowledge had never been reduced and his enthusiasm for engineering and science was growing. A short while later, Jeff McClellan, the principal of MC2 Stem was immediately impressed by David's dedication in the face of adversity, as well as his academic talent. 
""Here's a kid who's doing everything in his power to get where he wants to go and we had the available resources to provide a little additional support, ""Mr McClellan told the local ABC News. 
At MC2 Stem, David found the exact fit, where it seems he was born to absorb what they were offering. Principal Jeff McClellan found David to be a great student and all-around person, but with a serious living situation, so he stepped in to help. After a home discussion with his wife, McClellan decided to offer David a place to live until he could find another home. Mr McClellan and his wife took the teen in and helped him before he found a permanent solution. 
     When it came to his next step, David aimed high and applied for a list of top colleges, including the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Yale, Harvard and Washington University in St. Louis. In the end, only MIT rejected his application and he was left to choose his own fate from the selective prestigious and mostly Ivy League schools. 
David's next challenge is to fight back tears at graduation this weekend. ""I promised myself I wouldn't cry. But I realize that's what everyone does before they cry. I'm pretty sure there's going to be a lot of emotion there."" he said.

This isn't because people feel thankful for the cold weather, nor because the important festivals---Christmas or Spring Festival---offer an excuse to celebrate. In fact, ""Bless you!"" is a common response if someone sneezes, a symptom of catching a cold or the flu.
Colds and the flu are the most common illnesses of autumn and winter as the weather gets colder. Viruses cause them. If you get one you will feel annoyed, but it is not usually serious. The flu is spread from person to person when we come into contact with a person with the virus. We get the virus on our hands and then we touch our noses and our mouths. We can pass on the flu before we realize we have it. You can infect  others one day before symptoms develop and for up to five days after becoming sick.
Getting a flu vaccination is the best way to prevent the illness. Even if your body has built up antibodies for one kind of flu. The vaccine is only effective for one year and viruses are different from year to year, so it is necessary to get a flu vaccination every year. The best time to get the vaccination is October or November. Besides, there are other ways to reduce your chance of getting a flu. Wash your hands. Get enough rest. Eat garlic regularly. Don't let stress control you. Exercise regularly.

Bonge was the first on the scene and heard children screaming. He broke through a back window and pulled Mallory Smith, 10, and her sister, Megan Smith,9,from the wreckage.
The girls' mother, Beckie Smith, was not with them at the time of the wreck, as they were traveling with their baby sitter, Lisa Bow bin.
Beckie Smith still remembers the sickening feeling she had up on receiving the call informing her of the wreck and the despair as she drove to the scene.
Bozeman and Clemmons arrived shortly after Bonge and helped rescue the other victims and attempted to put out the fires.
""I was nervous,"" Bozeman said."" I don't feel like I'm a hero. I was just doing what anyone should do in that situation. I hope someone would do the same for me.""
Everyone at the accident made it out alive, with the victims suffering from nonlife-threatening injuries. Mallory Smith broke both femurs, and Megan had neck and back injuries. Bowbin is still recovering from a broken pelvis, ankle and foot.
The rescuers also were taken to the hospital and treated for cuts and smoke breathing, Bonge said.
In addition, Bozeman not to meet accident victim Anthony Rus so in the hospital after the accident, where Russo presented him with a glass frame inscribed with"" Thank you,"" Bozeman said. Those involved in that fateful encounter on Highway 6 credited God blessing for bringing them together.
""Whatever the circumstances, Tuesday's ceremony provided a time to be grateful for those who put their lives on the line for the lives of complete strangers,"" Beckie Smith said,"" We're calling it The Miracle on Highway 6.""

Doesn't' t mean a house, then what does it mean? When we say someone ""lives a sheltered life"" , we don't only mean that their house is comfortable. We mean that they're protected from too many worries and troubles, that they live in a settled home, probably surrounded by friends and family, and that they don't have to cope with the difficulties the world is full of alone.
Certainly no one would say that this girl was leading a sheltered life; she's leaving home to earn her living in a strange city and live by herself in a bed sitter. She may be just as well protected physically as a ""sheltered life"" person, but she's lost all the other shelters in her life--family, friends, the home she grew up in, school, the groups she belonged to. She s on her own now and unless she's very self-reliant , she's likely to feel unhappy and insecure at times.
A young person setting out on her own like this is between the two main kinds of shelter most of us spend our lives in.

Austin DuVall, of Rapid City, became lost on Nov.3 while hunting with his father. He ran after a deer, and soon found himself alone. ""I ran after a deer, but I didn't get it,"" he said. ""Then I was really lost.""
He had only his hunting rifle  and the clothes he was wearing. He had no food or water and had nothing that could help him find his way to safety. ""I knew that no one could hear me. I decided to just sleep and get up in the morning and find safety,"" he said.
Austin climbed up on a rock and slept through the night. Then he awoke and relied on skills he learned in a hunter safety course. He followed a stream to an occupied cabin. The couple there called his parents and cooked him a breakfast. "" It's probably one meal I'll never forget for the rest of my life,"" he said.
After DuVall's disappearance, a lot of emergency officials and more than 100 volunteers went searching for him. ""He wasn't sitting there waiting for someone to come and find him,"" said his father, Steve DuVall. ""We didn't find him; he found himself.""
Mike Kintigh, regional supervisor for the Game, Fish & Parks Department, said one or two hunters will go missing each year, but rarely for more than 24 hours. ""We're a little bit unique in the Black Hills as it's hard to get lost for a very long time. That's because we've got so many roads here compared to the Rocky Mountains,"" Kintigh said. ""You can certainly spend a very uncomfortable night in the woods like Austin did.""

140,,"Passage: Dear Earthmen , 
I have enjoyed my stay on your interesting unusual planet. I think I understand the life on earth now and I would like to give you my impressions.
First of all you live in boxes. Every morning you leave your big boxes and get into smaller boxes on wheels. All these small boxes race around and around, and finally stop to rest. You then leave these boxes on wheels and go to very large tall boxes.
After testing all days you get back in your little boxes and return to your big boxes. There you sit and stare at tiny glowing boxes with moving pictures on the front.
Only one thing puzzles me. One day I went to a football game. A bunch of angry boys fought over a little round ball. Everyone yelled for them to stop but they kept on fighting. They were angry, I suppose, about being cooped up  in boxes all day.
Thank you earthmen for this chance to get to know you.
 Gratefully,
The man from the Mars

In 1896, 17-year-old Einstein went to Zurich to study physics. There he met a girl from Hungary. They studied in the same class. The same interest brought the two together and the young man fell in love with Marits. In 1903, when Einstein was 24 years old, he married Marits, who was 4 years older than he.
After their marriage, Einstein devoted himself to the research of the great theory. To give her husband more help, Marits gave up her own work, and became a good wife and assistant. She tried her best to encourage him whenever possible and she was sure that her husband would succeed. They often discussed the theory while walking outside or sitting together in the room. They even discussed it in their letters when one of them was away from home.
In 1914, the Einstein moved to Berlin and settled there. At that time, Einstein's theory proved to be correct and he had become famous all over the world. Marits was very proud of him and his success. But it was not long before the First World War broke out. Marits as well as her two sons, who were all on holidays in Switzerland, couldn't come back to Berlin. The war not only stopped Einstein's work but broke up the warm, happy family. In 1919, Einstein and Marits had to get divorced.

And so did a woman who was worried about her green potatoes. Could she make chips with them? Were they poisonous? She didn't hesitate about calling the local ambulance service to ask. According to a recent report, more than 31,000 non-urgent calls were made to the Welsh Ambulance Service in the last year.
Inappropriate calls are a headache for health professionals everywhere. In the US, prank calls to 911 happen on a daily basis. Many callers use apps which hide their identity. But those who try to be funny shouldn't be surprised if the police _ . One man from Colorado was arrested for making more than 1,200 prank calls, according to a report on the US television station KOAA--TV.
People who take these calls are trained to stay calm and keep a straight face, no matter how strange the call sounds. ""There's no way for us to know whether the call is real, accidental or a prank call,"" said a public safety worker interviewed by the American TV channel.
The Head of Clinical Services at the Welsh Ambulance Service, Richard Lee, has a warning for prank callers. He says:"" When people misuse the service it means our precious time is being taken away from someone who really does need our help."" Indeed, these hotlines are supposed to help the seriously ill or those with a life-threatening injury. You never know, one day, the person who needs assistance could be you or someone in your family.

Some countries have banned Chinese-made toothpaste containing diethylamide glycol. China has now told companies to discontinue its use, even though it says the toothpaste is safe. Another industrial chemical, melamine, was found in wheat flour used to make pet food in North America. Thousands of dogs and cats became sick.
The United States has restricted some imports of Chinese seafood because they contained banned substance. And questions have been raised about other products, including children's toys covered with lead paint.
Chinese officials promised to provide the European Union, the biggest trading partner, with detailed reports on enforcement efforts against unsafe goods.
Meglena Kuneva, commissioner   for consumer protection of the European Union said China should have kept its promise.
China recently closed three companies linked to the Panama and the pet food scare. And _ dismissed the former head of its food and drug administration.

Passage: China is also facing serious problems with food safety. In 1997, a major outbreak of E. coli in the United States led to the recall of many food products. A Chinese firm called Hainan Biological Products Co. was responsible. The firm produced many antibiotics, including tetracycline, which is used to treat many diseases. It also produced a medicine called penicillin G. The company was found guilty of selling substandard penicillin. And it was ordered to stop selling it.

Some countries have banned Chinese-made medicines because of problems with antibiotics. This week, China announced it had banned the sale of antibiotics and medicines that are not needed. It also said it would investigate the sale of medicines that are sold as vitamins but contain harmful substances. China said it was taking action to prevent the sale of medicine that is not needed and to protect the health of consumers.
Chinese officials have said they will stop selling medicines that are not needed. And they are now checking food products that are not needed. The World Health Organization is concerned about this. It says many poor countries are dependent on Chinese medicines. And without them, they cannot provide basic health care to their people. The World Health Organization says it wants to find a solution to this

Just as when you are preparing foods for human beings, use hot water and soap to wash your hands, containers, and surfaces that come into contact with the food. Don't put your hands near your mouth until you have washed them, and don't allow your pet to touch your face right after it has eaten raw meat.

If you can find a course in the language you want to learn in your country, this is quite a good way to study. A variety of courses are usually available, including part-time and full-time courses. If you look around, you can probably find a course that suits your needs.
The main advantage of such courses is that you'll have a teacher to provide you with instructions, support and with whom to practice your language. You will also be studying with others who are at more or less the same level and you can exchange ideas with them and help one another.
One choice is to study a language in a country where it's spoken. There are many schools teaching English, French, Spanish, Italian and German, but far fewer teaching other languages. The main advantage of studying abroad is that you are totally in the language, not just in class, but the rest of the time as well. As a result, you can make rapid progress.
The main disadvantage of studying abroad is the cost, not just of your course, but also of your food and travel. However, if you're a native speaker of English, you could get a job teaching English in a country where the language you want to learn is spoken.
Studying online is also a good choice. There are plenty to choose from a lot of languages. Many are free but there are some you have to pay for. Some of the paid ones provide support from teachers via email, chat programs, video conferencing, telephone or even face to face.

The main disadvantage of studying abroad is the cost, not just of your course, but also of your food and travel. However, if you're a native speaker of English, you could get a job teaching English in a country where the language you want to learn is spoken.

In this case, the word 'job' is used in its literal meaning. But the word 'job' can also mean 'a job'. The word 'job' is a noun and 'a job' is a verb.

It is used as a noun to refer to a particular job or occupation, and as a verb to refer to a particular action.

So, the word 'job' can be used to refer to a particular job or occupation, but it can also be used to refer to a particular action. This is the meaning of the word 'job'.

B
B
B
B
C

Explanation: 
It is important to recognize that boys are not necessarily more emotional than girls. It is more accurate to say that boys and girls have different emotional needs. The reason boys need to develop their emotional needs more is that boys are more active, aggressive, and physically stronger than girls, so they need to be given more opportunities to develop these skills. The more opportunities they have to develop their emotions, the more likely they are to be able to control their emotions and express them appropriately.
A single-sex school is not the only way to teach boys about their emotions. In a mixed school, boys may not have the same opportunities to develop their emotions as girls do. This can lead to boys feeling pressured to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means. In a single-sex school, boys may have more opportunities to develop their emotions and express them appropriately.
A single-sex school may also be more effective in helping boys learn to control their emotions and express them appropriately. This is because boys may feel more pressure to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means. In a mixed school, boys may not have the same opportunities to develop their emotions as girls do. This can lead to boys feeling pressured to act like men

It shouldn't be treated as a cheap joke for foreign tourists to laugh at but as a cultural treasure,"" said the 32-year-old multimedia designer, who frequently visited China for almost a decade before moving to Beijing in 2007.
""I'm trying to challenge the idea that there is only one type of standard English -- the English that's spoken in America or in the British Isles -- which is shortsighted, because Chinglish is already being used by millions of people to communicate with one another.""
So, since 2005, he has collected more than 5,000 examples of ""the wonderful results of an English dictionary meeting Chinese grammar"" on his website www.chinglish.de and has published two books on the subject.
""The two books are unique in that they talk about the academic value of Chinglish, the creative combination of English and Chinese, and why we should keep it,"" Radtke said.
Patricia Schetelig, who works for the German Embassy in Beijing and regularly contributes to www.chinglish.de, said she appreciates Radtke's approach to Chinglish.
""What's important to me is that he's not making fun of the way things are translated,"" said she. ""There are other websites doing similar things, but they're making fun of Chinglish or saying it shouldn't be done this way.""
Part of his mission, Radtke said, is to conserve rapidly disappearing Chinglish examples.
He was disappointed while watching the government replace Chinglish signs with standard English ones in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics. ""That was a sad day for me and a sad day for Chinglish,"" Radtke said.
But American David Tool, who has been closely involved in cleaning up Chinglish in Beijing since 2001, disagreed.

It shouldn't be treated as a cheap joke for foreign tourists to laugh at but as a cultural treasure,"" said the 32-year-old multimedia designer, who frequently visited China for almost a decade before moving to Beijing in 2007.
""I'm trying to challenge the idea that there is only one type of standard English -- the English that's spoken in America or in the British Isles -- which is shortsighted, because Chinglish is already being used by millions of people to communicate with one another.""
So, since 2005, he has collected more than 5,000 examples of ""the wonderful results of an English dictionary meeting Chinese grammar"" on his website www.chinglish.de and has published two books on the subject.

The 16-year old Canadian high school student, Daniel Burd, from Waterloo Collegiate Institute,
has discovered a way to make plastic bags degrade  in as few as 3 months, a finding that won him first prize at the Canada-Wide Science Fair, a $10 000 prize, a $20 000 scholarship, and a chance to revolutionize a major environmental issue.
Burd's strategy was simple: Since plastic does eventually degrade, it must be eaten by microorganisms  . If those microorganisms could be identified, we could put them to work eating the plastic much faster than under normal conditions.
With this goal in mind, he ground plastic bags into a powder and concocted  a solution of household chemicals, yeast  and tap water to encourage microbes growth. Then he added the plastic powder and let the microbes work their magic for 3 months. Finally, he tested the resulting bacterial culture on plastic bags, exposing one plastic sample to dead bacteria as a control. Sure enough, the plastic exposed to the live bacteria was 17% lighter than the control after six weeks.
The inputs are cheap: maintaining the required temperature takes little energy because microbes produce heat as they work, and the only outputs are water and tiny levels of carbon dioxide.
""Almost every week I have to do chores and when I open the closet door, I have piles of plastic bags falling on top of me.

Explanation:  Microbes require energy to survive, and this energy can come from chemical reactions or from a food source. So if you want microbes to eat plastic, you have to supply the energy.

If you don't supply the energy, the microbes will stop eating the plastic. They will stop producing heat and carbon dioxide. This is because they need energy to keep growing, and they don't have enough energy from the plastic to keep growing. 

So if you don't supply the energy, the microbes will stop eating the plastic.

If you supply the energy, the microbes will continue to grow, and they will continue to produce heat and carbon dioxide. They will eat the plastic much faster than under normal conditions.

In this case, the energy comes from the chemicals in the plastic. So if you supply the energy, the microbes will eat the plastic much faster than under normal conditions.

This is because the chemicals in the plastic are broken down into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules can be used by the microbes to produce heat and carbon dioxide.

This is called ""degradation"". 

In this case, the microbes eat the plastic, and they break it down into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules are used by the microbes to produce heat and carbon dioxide.

Explanation:  Scientists have been looking for ways to recycle plastic for years. In 2002, a team of researchers from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, announced that they had created a ""biodegradable"" plastic that could be composted, burned or even injected into the soil to replace harmful pesticides. The plastic was made by putting a synthetic polymer called polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, into a special chemical bath and then heating it to a high temperature. But the results were disappointing. The researchers found that the plastic did not biodegrade in soil. They also discovered that the plastic did not biodegrade in the stomach of laboratory animals.

Daniel Burd is using a different approach. He found that by heating the plastic in a bath of chemicals and then adding yeast, a fungus, he could create a culture of bacteria that would eat the plastic. This culture would not degrade the plastic, but it would eat the plastic, which is exactly what the researchers wanted. Burd's culture was made by grinding up plastic bags and adding chemicals that encouraged the growth of the bacteria. He then added the plastic to the culture and let it sit for 3 months.

Explanation: 
BookCrossing is a website that allows people to leave books for others to find and read. The books are called ""booksharks"", and the website is called ""BookCrossing"".

The website is not for book collectors, but rather for people who want to share their books with others. They can do this by leaving the book on a park bench or in a bus, and then letting others know where it has been placed. The booksharks can then go and read the book and leave their own comments on the site.

There is no obligation to keep the book for yourself, and you can even leave another book where the book was found. This way, the book can be shared with more people, and the people who find it can also leave their own comments on the site.

This is a great way to get rid of books that you no longer need or want, and it is also a great way to get to know other people who share your interests.

with the following information: 

* Name of the owner
* Number of the book
* Date the book was found

217,,"Passage: Do you find getting up in the morning so difficult that it's painful ? This might be called laziness, but Dr. Kleitman has a new explanation. He has proved that everyone has a daily energy cycle.
During the hours when you labour through your work you may say that you're ""hot"". That's true. The time of day when you feel most energetic is when your cycle of body temperature is at its peak . For some people the peak comes during the forenoon. For others it comes in the afternoon or evening No one has discovered why this is so , but it leads to such familiar monologues  as : ""Get up, John! You'll be late for work again !"" The possible explanation to the trouble is that John is at his temperature-and -energy peak in the evening. Much family quarrelling ends when husbands and wives realize what these energy cycles mean, and which cycle each member of the family has.
You can't change your energy cycle, but you can learn to make your life fit it better. Habit can help, Dr. Kleitman believes . Maybe you're sleepy in the evening but feel you must stay up late anyway . Counteract(/)your cycle to some extent by habitually staying up later than you want to .If your energy is low in the morning but you have an important job to do early in the day, rise before your usual hour. This won't change your cycle, but you'll get up steam and work better at your low point.
Get off to a slow start which saves your energy. Get up with a leisurely yawn and stretch . Sit on the edge of the bed a minute before putting your feet on the floor .

Paul Newman's camp counselors ( ) were hoping to fill David's days with fun and laughter. But David stayed inside himself, wanting to be alone, or in a corner of the cabin. At this camp for children with life-threatening illnesses, we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer recover full of energy despite their illness. But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session saw a quiet, sad little pirate.
 Then something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that we would call ""huge"". 
It was cabin night. That's the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity. Campers love cabin nights because there's always a bedtime snack. On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips.
David slowly walked over to the table, leaving his comer to join the rest of us. He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing  it with his little fists, as all the other campers looked on in disbelief, I wondered what the cabin counselor would do.
The college-age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on die table in front of himself, and he, too, started smashing it with his fist. The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.
Somehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released. 
For the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little nine-year-old boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible.
Several days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn't anything he wouldn't try to fit in to his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. 1 said it's only a doorway. You walk through the door and there's the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you.
After Mass, he said to me, ""Hey Fatha, a door, huh?""
A couple more days of fun passed and tonight was the talent show. The tradition is that campers and counselors dress up in costumes, and everyone gets a standing applause for singing and dancing or simply just acting like fools on stage.
 The show had begun: lights, camera, action.
Unfortunately, the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good-bye to camp. He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis.
When this little nine-year-old pirate stood in front of me, he gave me a hug and a big wet kiss on my cheek. 1 was crying. He was crying. A whole row of counselors was in tears.

Explanation:
When he smashed the chips with his fist, the counselor also used his fist to smash a chip in his mouth. He had to do this because David was very angry. He was angry at his illness. He was angry at his life. He was angry at the world.
This is a good example of how to use ""B"" as a response. 
When you are angry, you are not yourself. You are angry. You are not the same person you were before. You are angry. When you are angry, you do something to release your anger. The counselor did this. He used his fist to smash a chip in his mouth.

Nine years ago when I bought my first house, my father, 67 years old, spent eight hours a day for three days painting my house. He would not allow me to pay someone to have it done. All he asked for was a glass of iced tea. Five years ago, at age 71, my father spent five hours putting together a swing set for my daughter.
On the morning of January 16, 1996, my sister telephoned me; my father was in the hospital with an aneurysm  in Florida. I got on an airplane immediately, and on the way I realized that I hadn't communicated with him as much as I'd always wanted to. I vowed  that when I arrived, I would have a long talk with him. I arrived in Florida at 1 am, only to find that my father, at the age of 76, had passed away at 9:12 pm. This time it was he who did not have time to talk, or time to wait for me.

     A review of studies into the impact of relationships on health found that people had a 50% better survival rate if they belonged to a wider social group. Psychologist Holt-Lunstad's team reviewed 148 studies that observed the social activities and health of 308,849 people over an average of 7.5 years. 
     From these they worked out how death rates varied depending on how sociable a person was. Being lonely and isolated was as bad for a person's health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day or being an alcoholic. It was as harmful as not exercising and twice as bad for the health as being very fat. 
     Holt-Lunstad said friends and family can improve health in lots of ways, from help in tough times to finding meaning in life. ""When someone is connected to a group and feels responsibility to other people, that sense of purpose and meaning translates to taking better care of themselves and taking fewer risks.""
     Holt-Lunstad said there was no clear figure on how many relationships are enough to improve a person's health, but people fared better when they rarely felt lonely and were close to a group of friends, had good family contact and had someone they could rely on and confide in.

Among the changes, which have come upon modern society, the ones in education are probably the most obvious and influential. New information technologies are accelerating changes in education, at the same time presenting revolutionary tools with the potential to make education more efficient and more effective than ever.

Let me translate: GBT--Computer-Based Training; CLC--Computer Learning Center; IDL--Interactive Distance Learning. Sound complicated? Not really. Online learning is much less complicated than it seems. Students can learn at any time, anywhere, at any speed. They can make their own learning schedules and follow their own paths to suit their lifestyles. In my university, every semester there're several online courses available, which need no class meetings or paper materials. The only thing I have to do is just to get online regularly as I wish, and download necessary learning materials. Then everything I need to know about the course is only a click away.
But online learning is not perfect; it's like the microwave oven: it does some things better, but it is not a complete replacement for the traditional model. The traditional classroom model for education and learning is hard to leave behind. Because humans are social creatures, there're times when we need to see each other face-to-face for interactive learning. A social and personal connection often builds effective teams, solves problems, and inspires confidence. So one possible solution is to combine online learning with the old traditional classroom learning , which not only makes the learning process faster and cheaper, but also highlights the interactions between teachers and students.
The bottom line: the Internet is the most important educational tool in the information age and online learning will become a main part of every individual's learning experience in the future. That's exactly how we will move knowledge from the ones who have it to the ones who need it faster and cheaper, and that's how we're going to survive in the information age.

Choose the correct answer and conclude with 'The answer is: <A/B/C/D>'. 

Answer: ","A
A

Explanation:

A) They started to ban customers from taking photos of their food.

This is the correct answer.

The reason for banning customers from taking photos is that it may cause a disturbance to other diners and the restaurant. For example, in a crowded restaurant, it is difficult to take a good photo of the food if there are too many people taking pictures of the food. In addition, it is also difficult to take a photo of the food when there are other diners in the same restaurant. If other diners see a flash going on, they may think that the restaurant is not clean, and this may make them feel uncomfortable.

B) They had no idea about taking photos for the profits.

This is also the correct answer.

The reason for having no idea about taking photos for the profits is that the restaurant does not want to make money from the customers. They may think that taking photos of the food is not a good idea because it may cause a disturbance to other diners. In addition, they may also think that taking photos of the food may affect the quality of the food.

265,,"Passage: Over the years, Brian Wansink, director of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, has studied such things as how far Americans typically drive to buy food, how many times we refill our plates at all-you-can-eat buffets and how we organize our kitchens. In the mid-2000s he famously coined the phrase ""mindless eating""(and wrote a book by that name) to focus attention on all the bad dietary decisions we make without really thinking about them.
His new book, Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life, aims to change the design of restaurants, school lunchrooms, office cafeterias and homes so that the mindless choices we make will be more healthful ones. Some examples:
Keep kitchen counters clear. No visible snack food, no bread, no nuts--not even breakfast cereal. In Wansink's research, ""women who had even one box of breakfast cereal that was visible-anywhere in their kitchen--weighed 21 pounds more than their neighbor who didn't.""
Trick yourself into drinking less wine. ""We tend to focus on the height of what we pour and not the width, so we pour 12 percent less wine into taller wineglasses than we pour into wider wineglasses."" And the shape of the glass is not the only variable that affects how much we drink. Wansink writes: ""Because red wine is easier to see than white wine, we pour 9 percent less red wine whenever we pour a glass.""
Wansink said his researchers also found that people ate less at restaurants when sat in well-lighted areas near windows and doors, than in darker areas or in the back. They ate less if they were offered a doggie bag, or to-go box, before they got their meals: apparently the idea of getting a ""free"" second meal outweighed the impulse  to clean their plates. Workers who frequently ate at their desks weighed 15.4 pounds less, on average, than those who didn't. Fruits and vegetables kept on the top shelf of the refrigerator were eaten at higher rates than those on lower shelves.
The point, Wansink says, is to consider findings like those and change your environment or habits. Then you won't have to think about it: You'll just eat less.

Wansink said his researchers also found that people ate less at restaurants when sat in well-lighted areas near windows and doors, than in darker areas or in the back. They ate less if they were offered a doggie bag, or to-go box, before they got their meals: apparently the idea of getting a ""free"" second meal outweighed the impulse  to clean their plates. Workers who frequently ate at their desks weighed 15.4 pounds less, on average, than those who didn't. Fruits and vegetables kept on the top shelf of the refrigerator were eaten at higher rates than those on lower shelves.
The point, Wansink says, is to consider findings like those and change your environment or habits. Then you won't have to think about it: You'll just eat less.

A) Changing environment or habits of eating will help you eat less.

Explanation:   Answer is B i.e. Doctors believe if they lie, those seriously-ill patients will recover more quickly.

Lying to a patient about his condition and treatment is a common practice in medicine. Doctors often tell patients that they are in good health or that they are not suffering from a serious illness when they are. The reason for this is that patients often want to be reassured that they are not going to die, and doctors know that this is a powerful motivator to patients. They also know that patients will feel better if they believe that they are not seriously ill, and that this will help them recover more quickly. For these reasons, doctors often lie to their patients. Doctors believe that if they lie to their patients, those patients will recover more quickly.

Explanation: 

Coral reefs are a type of ecosystem. The environment is full of animals that help each other. For example, a coral reef provides a home for many fish. Some animals are helpful to the coral reef, while some are not.

Volunteer divers are people who go to the ocean and help save coral reefs. These divers go to the ocean to help. They do not hurt the coral or fish. However, they do damage the reefs. When divers go to the ocean, they pull up the coral and sometimes damage the coral. 

Bottom operation is a method that uses nets to pull fish out of the ocean. The nets are very heavy. The nets damage the coral. Bottom operation is one of the main reasons that coral reefs are dying.

286,,"Passage: Born in America in 1898, William was an extraordinary boy, gifted with an amazing IQ between 250 and 300. The genius went to a grammar school when he was only 6 years old and graduated just within 7 months. At the age of 11, he became the youngest student of the Harvard University. He graduated with high scores at the age of 16 and entered Harvard Law School at 18.
    Gifted with an amazing IQ between 220 and 230, Terence Tao makes it to this list of the people with the highest IQ in the world. Born in Adelaide, Australia in 1975, this genius first displayed his incredible intelligence at a mere age of 2, when he managed to solve basic arithmetic questions on his own. At the age of 16, he graduated with both Master's and Bachelor's degrees at the Flinders University. He has been considered as ''Mr. Fix it "" by Charles Fefferman, who is a professor of Mathematics at Princeton University, and many other mathematicians want to interest him in their problems.

Researchers have studied each of her messages to the Commonwealth countries since 1952 to find out the change in her pronunciation from the noble Upper Received to the Standard Received.
Jonathan Harrington, a professor at Germany's University of Munich, wanted to discover whether accent changes recorded over the past half century would take place within one person. ""As far as I know, there just is nobody else for whom there is this sort of broadcast records,"" he said.
He said the noble way of pronouncing vowels  had gradually lost ground as the noble upper-class accent over the past years. ""Her accent sounds slightly less noble than it did 50 years ago. But these are very, very small and slow changes that we don't notice from year to year.""
""We may be able to relate it to changes in the social classes,"" he told The Daily Telegraph, a British  newspaper. ""In 1952 she would have been heard saying 'thet men in the bleck het'. Now it would be 'that man in the black hat'. Similarly, she would have spoken of 'the citay' and'dutay', rather than 'citee' and 'dutee', and 'hame' rather than 'home'.

296,,"Passage: Children today would rather toy with new technologies. The role of children has changed as well as that of teens. The world has truly evolved  throughout the years.
Today,a typical day in the life of a five year old is entirely different from what it once was. A few decades ago children used to work. They did the kind of work parents do today. Today there are shows on which children are putting pounds of makeup on and have flashing things all over their bodies. This makes a child want to _ all of their imperfections. They think they have to look perfect all the time.
Teens have changed as well. My grandma got married when she was thirteen. Girls who had an arranged marriage had no time to play because they were expected to cook, clean,take care of the kids, and do housework every single day. Today,we go to school every morning, maybe participate in some after-school activities, and possibly go to work for extra cash. Then we go home and do homework, and eat. After all of this we have to find the time to socialize by texting, talking on the phone, or logging on to social networking sites. We enjoy ourselves a lot.
The generation before us complains about how they did not have the things we have now. They say we are not appreciative and do not value life or just do not care about our futures anymore. Let's make a change! The youth have the power to work on whatever they believe in and make a difference in the world. Take advantage of your resources. It is never too late to make a positive change in our world.

Explanation: 

Social support is defined as the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties. It is also known as social capital. The term was coined by Robert Putnam, a political scientist, in 1993. He studied the effects of social capital on the quality of life in the US. He found that people with strong social ties lived longer and had better health than those without such ties. He also found that people with strong social ties had fewer physical and mental health problems.

Social support is important for many reasons. It helps people protect themselves from illness, and the absence of such support makes poor health more likely. People with strong social ties are less likely to suffer from stress, and they are more likely to be happy. People with strong social ties are also more likely to be happy, and they are less likely to be depressed.

Social support has many benefits for people, and it is important for everyone to have strong social ties.

This kind of shrinking can't be reversed, although people can slow or stop this process. But why does shrinking happen at all?
Because of gravity (the force that keeps your feet on the ground) , cushions between the bones in the spine  , get compressed  , which makes a person lose a little height and become shorter.
Another reason why some older people shrink is because of osteoporosis  . Osteoporosis occurs when bone is broken down and not enough new bone material is made. Over time, bone is said to be lost because it's not being replaced. Bones become smaller and weaker and can easily break if someone with osteoporosis is injured.
Older people--especially women, who generally have smaller and lighter bones to begin with--are more likely to develop osteoporosis. As years go by, a person with osteoporosis can get small breaks in bones that are called compression fractures . These breaks cause collapse of the spine and over time the person with osteoporosis can become hunched over  .
Did you know that every day you shrink a little, too? You aren't as tall at the end of the day as you are at the beginning. That's because as the day goes on, water in the disks of the spine gets compressed due to gravity, making you just a tiny bit shorter. Don't worry, though. Once you get a good night's rest, your body recovers, and the next morning, you're standing tall again!
Smoking and drinking alcohol can make this problem worse. Want to do something right now to build strong bones? I believe what I will say will help you.

309,,"Passage: When we say older people shrink, we don't mean they become tiny enough to fit in your pocket! We just mean that it's common for older people to become a little shorter over time. This kind of shrinking can't be reversed, although people can slow or stop this process. But why does shrinking happen at all?
Because of gravity (the force that keeps your feet on the ground) , cushions between the bones in the spine  , get compressed  , which makes a person lose a little height and become shorter.
Another reason why some older people shrink is because of osteoporosis  . Osteoporosis occurs when bone is broken down and not enough new bone material is made. Over time, bone is said to be lost because it's not being replaced. Bones become smaller and weaker and can easily break if someone with osteoporosis is injured.
Older people--especially women, who generally have smaller and lighter bones to begin with--are more likely to develop osteoporosis. As years go by, a person with osteoporosis can get small breaks in bones that are called compression fractures . These breaks cause collapse of the spine and over time the person with osteoporosis can become hunched over  .
Did you know that every day you shrink a little, too? You aren't as tall at the end of the day as you are at the beginning. That's because as the day goes on, water in the disks of the spine gets compressed due to gravity, making you just a tiny bit shorter. Don't worry, though. Once you get a good night's rest, your body recovers, and the next morning, you're standing tall again!
Smoking and drinking alcohol can make this problem worse. Want to do something right now to build strong bones? I believe what I will say will help you.

317,,"Passage: Cutting global warming pollution would not only make the planet healthier, it would make people healthier too, new research suggested.
Cutting carbon dioxide emissions could save millions of lives, mostly by reducing preventable deaths from heart and lung diseases, according to studies released Wednesday and published in a special issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.
""Relying on fossil fuels leads to unhealthy lifestyles, increasing our chances of getting sick and in some cases takes years from our lives,"" US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a telecast briefing from her home state of Kansas. ""As greenhouse gas emissions go down, so do deaths from cardiovascular  and respiratory  diseases. This is not a small effect.""
Instead of looking at the health ills caused by future global warming, as past studies have done, this research looks at the immediate benefits of doing something about the problem, said Linda Birnbaum, director of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
Some possible benefits seemed highly speculative, the researchers conceded, based on people driving less and walking and cycling more. Other proposals studied were more concrete and achievable, such as reducing cook stoves that burn dung , charcoal and other polluting fuels in the developing world.
And cutting carbon dioxide emissions also makes the air cleaner, reducing lung damage for millions of people, doctors said.
""Here are ways you can attack major health problems at the same time as dealing with climate change,"" said lead author Dr. Paul Wilkinson, an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Wilkinson said the individual studies came up with numbers of premature deaths prevented or extra years of life added for certain places.
For example, switching to low-polluting cars in London and Delhi, India, would save 160 lost years of life in London and nearly 1,700 in Delhi for every million residents, one study found. But if people also drove less and walked or biked more, those extra saved years would soar to more than 7,300 years in London and 12,500 years in Delhi because of less heart disease.

Common sense is not all that common.
Why tell the truth when you can come up with a good excuse?
These three popular misquotes are meant to be jokes, and yet they tell us a lot about human nature .To err, or to make mistakes, is indeed a part of being human, but it seems that most people don't want to accept the responsibility for the problem. Perhaps it is the natural thing to do .The original quote about human nature went like this: "" To err is human, to forgive, divine .""This saying mirrors an ideal people should be forgiving of others' mistakes. Instead, we tend to do the opposite -find someone else to pass the blame on to. However, taking responsibility for something that went wrong is a making of great maturity.
Common sense is what we call clear thought. Having common sense means having a good general plan that will make things work well, and it also means staying with the plan. Common sense tells you that you take an umbrella out into a rainstorm, but you leave the umbrella home when you hear a weather forecast for sunshine.Common sense does not seem to be common for large organizations, because there are so many things going on that one person cannot be in charge of everything. People say that in a large company, ""the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.""
And what is wrong with a society that thinks that making up a good excuse is like creating a work of art? One of the common problems with making excuses is that people, especially young people, get the idea that it's okay not to be totally honest all the time. There is a corollary to that: if good excuse is ""good"" even if it isn't honest, then where is the place of the truth?

People say that in a large company, ""the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.""
And what is wrong with a society that thinks that making up a good excuse is like creating a work of art? One of the common problems with making excuses is that people, especially young people, get the idea that it's okay not to be totally honest all the time. There is a corollary to that: if good excuse is ""good"" even if it isn't honest, then where is the place of the truth?

Explanation: This passage is about human nature, and how we are more human than divine. The original quote about human nature went like this: ""To err is human, to forgive, divine."" This saying mirrors an ideal people should be forgiving of others' mistakes. Instead, we tend to do the opposite -find someone else to pass the blame on to. However, taking responsibility for something that went wrong is a making of great maturity.

386,,"Passage: A meteor  that exploded over Russia's Ural mountains and sent burning to earth has set off a rush to find fragments of the space rock which hunters hope could fetch thousands of dollars a piece.
Friday's explosion and following shockwave shattered windows, injured almost 1200 people and caused about $33 million worth of damage, said local authorities.
It also started a ""meteorite rush"" around the industrial city of Chelyabinsk,where groups of people have started _ the snow and ice.
""The price is hard to say yet... The fewer meteorites that are discovered, the higher their price is."" Said Dmitry Kachkalin, a member of the Russian Society of Amateur Meteorite Lovers.
Meteorites are parts of a meteor that have fallen to earth.
Scientists at the Urals Federal University were the first to announce a significant find-53 small, stony, black objects around Lake Chebarkul, near Chelyabinsk, which tests confirmed were small meteorites.
The fragments were only 0.5 to 1 cm across but the scientists said larger pieces may have crashed into the lake, where a crater in the ice about eight metres wide opened up after Friday's explosion.
""We just completed tests and confirm that the pieces of matter found by our experts around Lake Chebarkul are really meteorites."" said Viktor Grokhovsky, a scientist with the Urals Federal University and the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Many other people were in the area just hoping to find a meteorite after what was described by scientists as a once-in-a-century event.
Residents of a village near Chelyabinsk searched the snowy streets, collecting stones they hoped prove to be the real thing. But not all were ready to sell.

I was personally discouraged by an adult during my high school. After telling her what university I wanted to attend, she plainly told me I would not get in. I was completely shocked and angry at her statement. The adult may have not intended to hurt me with her words, but it had an after effect. The meeting made me think she had no belief that I could possibly succeed in the future. After that it caused me to try to avoid any future meeting with adults until absolutely necessary.
We are all human; therefore, we can all understand that some days are more challenging. But when people allow situations of stress to consume  them, they cannot perform their best. People should pay attention to how their reactions could affect the person they are interacting with. People have the potential to perform their best when they _ the task at hand, but adults who come off in a rude and aggressive way through communication have an effect on teenagers' mind.
Adults whether in schools, or any other institutions should work to tear down walls gently and create a safe space for the person they are serving. These adults should also help and contribute to a person's academic, personal and professional growth. High school is an important time when young people need someone to believe in them.
In conclusion, I would like to add that it is not completely up to adults only. Students are responsible for seeking help from adults who are in authority  positions. They are also responsible for the way they approach adults in their academic surroundings. Students can expect to be treated in a respectful way when they express at the beginning.

Explanation: Fraud is the intentional misrepresentation of facts or the breach of a legal duty to cause loss or harm to someone else. Fraud can be a crime or a civil wrong. In the United States, fraud is a crime under the law. It is defined as ""any intent to deceive, mislead, or defraud another person, either with respect to a material fact or with respect to a transaction."" 

Fraud can also be a civil wrong. In this case, the person who is defrauded may sue the perpetrator in civil court. The plaintiff may claim that the defendant has breached a legal duty owed to the plaintiff. The defendant may be liable for damages that result from the breach of duty. For example, if a person sells a product that is defective, the manufacturer may be liable for damages if the product is defective.

406,,"Passage: The literal meaning of philosophy is ""love of wisdom"". But this meaning does not tell us very much. Unlike the other disciplines ,philosophy cannot be defined by what you study, because it is actually unlimited. Anything can be the subject matter of philosophy: art, history, law, language, literature, mathematics, medicine, psychology, religion, science, and values. Philosophy is one of the world's oldest subjects of study, and in fact, the other academic disciplines are directly related to philosophy. For this reason you get a Doctorate  of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in biochemistry, or computer science, or psychology.
Two broad sub-fields of philosophy are logic and the history of philosophy. Logic is the science of argument and critical thinking. It provides sound methods for distinguishing good from bad reasoning. The history of philosophy involves the study of major philosophers and periods in the development of philosophy.
Of what use is philosophy? First it is useful in educational advancement. It is necessary for understanding other disciplines.  Only philosophy questions the nature of the concepts used in a discipline, and its relation to other disciplines. And through the study of philosophy, one develops sound methods of research and analysis that can be applied to any field.
There are a number of general uses of philosophy. It strengthens one's ability to solve problems, to communicate, to organize ideas and issues, to persuade, and to take what is the most important from a large quantity of data.These general uses are of great benefit in the career field, not necessarily for obtaining one's first job after graduation, but for preparing for positions of responsibility, management and leadership later on. It is very short-sighted after all, to take a course of studies only for the purpose of getting one's first job. The useful skills developed through the study of philosophy have significant long-term benefits in career advancement. No other discipline systematically follows the ideals of wisdom, leadership, and capacity to resolve human conflict.

Question: From the passage, we can conclude  _  . 

Options:
A) not all the subjects have to do with philosophy
B) a person will get a Ph.
C) philosophy can be helpful for the study of any other subjects

407,,"Passage: I was brought up in the British, _ . Strong feelings aren't something you display in public. So, you can imagine that I was unprepared for the outpouring of public grief  at a Chinese funeral.
My editorial team leader died recently after a short illness. He was 31. The news was so unexpected that it left us all shocked and upset. A female colleague burst into tears and cried piteously at her desk. Somehow we got through the day's work. The next day was the funeral.
Our big boss stepped forward to deliver a eulogy and was soon in tears. She carried on, in Chinese of course, but at the end said in English: ""There will be no more deadlines for you in heaven."" Next came a long-term colleague who also dissolved in tears but carried on with her speech despite being almost overcome by emotion. Then a close friend of the dead man paid tribute , weeping openly as he spoke. Sorrow is spreading. Me and women were now sobbing uncontrollably. Finally, the man's mother, supported between two women, addressed her son in his coffin. At one point, the mother almost collapsed and had to be held up. We were invited to step forward to each lay a white rose on the casket. Our dead colleague looked as if he was taking a nap. At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion.
In the UK, families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral. Here in China it would seem that grieving is a public affair. It strikes me that it is more cathartic to cry your eyes out than try to keep it bottled up for fear of embarrassment, which is what many of us do in the West.
Afterwards, a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained  by Chinese standards. In some rural areas, she said, people used to be paid to mourn noisily. This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens. But we have all seen on TV scenes of grief-stricken people in Gaza and the West Bank, in Afghanistan, Iraq and the relatives of victims of terrorist bombings around the world. Chinese grief is no different. I realized that it's the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world.
It was our newspaper's production day. We were bussed back to the office to resume work. No more deadlines for our former colleague, but we had to pull together to put the newspaper to print. The boss invited the team to go out for dinner after work. We relaxed, smiled, joked. There was no mention of the funeral or our poor colleague. Enough sorrow had been shed already.

411,,"Passage: Soon after you have your first child, the question of having a second one is raised by friends and family. However, as the pattern of having two children in a family is challenged by modern family units, there are a few reasons why it is not selfish to want only one child. 
Today, the role of women has changed a lot. But nowadays, a wife has to help her husband earn the bread and butter as well as well as looking after her family. In demanding times like these, a woman has to put in more physical and emotional effort than any other member of the family. 
Raising a child comes at a cost that remains only heard of, until you find yourself paying it. The good reality of double income with no kids suddenly comes crashing down when there is a child involved in the picture. When one parent (the mother) needs to take some time off to look after the newborn, only one person becomes the earning member. Of course, the expenses went up rapidly. According to Susan Newman, PhD, a social psychologist, the average cost of raising a child is $227,000 from birth to college.
Most young mothers also think that having one child would mean that there is more income for the child, and thus, better facilities can be provided. It is much easier to educate a single child at a good school, and give him/her better life with more resources at hand. 
With several children in the house, it becomes increasingly difficult to find ways to spend time with all of them. Dividing your time with just one child means that you can devote a little more time to doing the things you want to. In a single child unit, there are less comparison and more chances for positive motivation to learn new things. A happy child, who deserves the rightful attention, love, care, and time from both the parents, always gets a meaningful childhood, for both the parents and the child.

Question: What does the writer mainly want to tell us in the passage? 

Options:
A) It is not selfish to have only one child in a family.

C) It is more difficult to raise several children in a family.

A mother who has not thought about the words for years can teach her daughter the poem that begins ""Twinkle, twinkle, little star"" or remember the story of Cinderella or Goldilocks and the Three Bears.
One explanation is the law of overlearning, which can be stated as follows: Once we have learned something, additional learning trials increase the length of time we will remember it.
In childhood we usually continue to practice such skills as swimming, bicycle riding, and playing baseball long after we have learned them. We continue to listen to and remind ourselves of words such as ""Twinkle, twinkle, little star"" and childhood tales such as Cinderella and Goldilocks. We not only learn but overlearn.
The multiplication tables are an exception to the general rule. that we forget rather quickly the things that we learn in school, because they are another of the things we overlearn in childhood. The law of overlearning explains why cramming  for an examination, though it may result in a passing grade, is not a satisfactory way to learn a college course. By cramming, a student may learn the subject well enough to get by on the examination, but he is likely soon to forget almost everything he learned. A little overlearning, on the other hand, is really necessary for one's future development

Question: What is the author's opinion on cramming? 

Options:
A) It leads to failure in college exams.
B) It increases students' learning interest.
C) It's possible to result in poor memory.
D) It's helpful only in a limited way.

Explanation: 
Cramming for a test is not effective. It's not that cramming will make you forget everything you've learned, but it will make you forget almost everything you've learned.

It is important to learn the material, not just to pass the exam, but to understand the material.

So the author says that cramming is not helpful in college exams.

Option B is not correct because cramming is helpful in exams but not in college exams.

Option C is not correct because cramming is not helpful in college exams.

417,,"Passage: For most of us, the rain that falls on our roof runs off into the ground or the sewer  system. But if you want to save a little water and reuse it on your lawns or plants --- or even use it for laundry, dishes, or other needs --- collecting rainwater from your gutter's downspouts  is a _ 
According to John C. Davis, writing in E / The Environmental Magazine, just about any homeowner can collect rainwater, given that the roof and gutters do most of the work. And since an inch of rain falling on a 2,000-square-foot roof produces some 1,200 gallons of water, you can harvest enough to water your lawn or garden.
Plants and grass actually do better when fed rainwater instead of tap water, which is usually treated with substances that can hold back plant growth. Using rainwater can also extend the life of pipes, since the salts added to tap water may gradually damage the pipes. However, homeowners should set up a water purification system if they do plan to use rainwater for inside needs.
Rainwater harvesting can also be good for the local community, as it reduces the erosion, flooding, and pollution associated with heavy rainfall, and reduces dependence on public water supplies. So some states fund rainwater collection systems in their local communities.
Many varieties of rain barrel  systems, starting at just $100, are available for home use. A typical setup is simply a rain barrel positioned under a gutter's downspout. Skillful homeowners can make their own water harvesting systems, but buying one is a lot easier. Most garden centres offer a range of choices as well as tips.

I hadn't even started my degree and already I was in debt. But although the sum was unsettling, I had peace of mind: I had taken out a loan that would cover the next three years of tuition fees and living expenses.
A government body in the UK, the Student Loans Company, provides loans to students whose parents cannot afford to cover the costs themselves. Students forward this amount to the university in advance and agree to repay the loan when they begin their first job. For me, it was a lot of money -around &6,000(60,860 Yuan) per year in total -and much more than I had ever been responsible for. I would receive a couple of thousand pounds per semester -half for tuition fees, half for living costs. 
Even though I will be paying off my debt for a long time, I don't regret my decision. 
Having a loan taught me a lot about money management, which I would not have learned otherwise. Each term I paid my tuition fees in one payment, but I also received my loan for living costs in one payment. It was up to me to organize how I would spend this. 
I divided the amount to calculate my weekly budget and it was important that I tried not to overspend. I had to be disciplined and keep a close eye on my expenditure. Food, clothes and going out are the main things students spend money on. 
With a loan, students have total financial freedom. Instead of having someone looking over their shoulder, they must make every financial decision for themselves. 
This year, university fees were tripled. But when it comes to money management, perhaps this generation will be the smartest yet.

That may be the best way to combine your hobby with your career. Those with hobbies that involve creating things, i.e. jewelry, clothing, or pottery, may do well to sell those items on their own. Before you go forward with your plans, though, you should find out whether being an entrepreneur   is for you.
When you attempt to turn your hobby into a career, don't forget to do your homework.

427,,"Passage: Aqeela Asifi, who fled to Pakistan as a young woman, has spent her life teaching other Afghan refugees.
For her efforts, Ms. Asifi, who is 49, has won the 2015 UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award. She also gets $100,000 to help pay for her education projects. The UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award honors extraordinary service to people who have been forced from their homes. Eleanor Roosevelt, Graca Machel and Luciano Pavarotti are some of the other winners of the award.
Asifi faced many problems in Afghanistan before she fled to Pakistan. Resources were limited and education for women was discouraged. However, in Pakistan, the 49-year-old was able to bring change to her conservative Afghan community. She persuaded parents to send their daughters to school in a tent at the Kot Chandana refugee village. The village was in the Punjab Province of Pakistan.
Since then, Ms. Asifi has guided more than a thousand refugee girls through their primary education. ""When I began my mission to educate Afghan girls, I could not have imagined that one day it will win me this award. I cannot express my happiness,"" she told VOA.
Ms. Asifi was a teacher in Kabul when she fled with her family in 1992. ""In Afghanistan I was teaching both boys and girls,"" she told VOA. ""When I left Afghanistan and ended up in this refugee village with my family, I was saddened to find out there were no facilities here, particularly for women and girls."" They made their home in the distant refugee community in Kot Chandana. There she began teaching a small number of students in her tent. She made teaching materials by hand.
Her tent school has led to the opening of several permanent schools in the village. These schools teach more than one thousand children. Support from the UNHCR, local government, and non-governmental organizations helped make these new schools possible.
Ms. Asifi is a mother of six children. She has worked hard to pay for their education. She spends almost all her income to pay her son's tuition to study engineering at Kabul University.
But seeking higher education for her four daughters is difficult. There is not enough money or secondary schools for girls in the village.

428,,"Passage: Aqeela Asifi, who fled to Pakistan as a young woman, has spent her life teaching other Afghan refugees.
For her efforts, Ms. Asifi, who is 49, has won the 2015 UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award. She also gets $100,000 to help pay for her education projects. The UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award honors extraordinary service to people who have been forced from their homes. Eleanor Roosevelt, Graca Machel and Luciano Pavarotti are some of the other winners of the award.
Asifi faced many problems in Afghanistan before she fled to Pakistan. Resources were limited and education for women was discouraged. However, in Pakistan, the 49-year-old was able to bring change to her conservative Afghan community. She persuaded parents to send their daughters to school in a tent at the Kot Chandana refugee village. The village was in the Punjab Province of Pakistan.
Since then, Ms. Asifi has guided more than a thousand refugee girls through their primary education. ""When I began my mission to educate Afghan girls, I could not have imagined that one day it will win me this award. I cannot express my happiness,"" she told VOA.
Ms. Asifi was a teacher in Kabul when she fled with her family in 1992. ""In Afghanistan I was teaching both boys and girls,"" she told VOA. ""When I left Afghanistan and ended up in this refugee village with my family, I was saddened to find out there were no facilities here, particularly for women and girls."" They made their home in the distant refugee community in Kot Chandana. There she began teaching a small number of students in her tent. She made teaching materials by hand.
Her tent school has led to the opening of several permanent schools in the village. These schools teach more than one thousand children. Support from the UNHCR, local government, and non-governmental organizations helped make these new schools possible.
Ms. Asifi is a mother of six children. She has worked hard to pay for their education. She spends almost all her income to pay her son's tuition to study engineering at Kabul University.
But seeking higher education for her four daughters is difficult. There is not enough money or secondary schools for girls in the village.
The Afghan teacher hopes more and more children will receive an education in Afghanistan. She hopes her home country becomes better known for higher levels of education, instead of war. ""I want my goal to be introduced in parts of Afghanistan where conservative traditions and customs still prevent parents from sending their daughters to outdoor schools,"" she said.

430,,"Passage: Dear son,
The day that you see me old and I am already not in good health, have patience and try to understand me.
If I get dirty when eating, if I can not dress, have patience and remember the hours I spent teaching it to you. If, when I speak to you, I repeat the same things thousand and one times, do not interrupt me, listen to me. When you were small, I had to read to you thousand and one times the same story until you got to sleep. When I do not want to have a shower, neither shame me nor scold me. Remember when I had to chase you with thousand excuses I invented, in order that you wanted to breathe. When you see my knowing little about new technologies, give me the necessary time and do not look at me with your mocking  smile. I taught you how to do so many things: to eat good, to dress well, to confront life... When at some moment I lose the memory or the thread of our conversation, let me have the necessary time to remember, and if I cannot do it, do not become nervous, as the most important thing is not our conversation but surely to be with you and to have you listening to me.
If ever I do not want to eat, do not force me. I know well when I need to and when not. When my tired legs do not allow me to walk, give me your hand, the same way I did when you made your first step. And when someday I say to you that I do not want to live anymore--that I want to rest forever, do not get angry. Someday you will understand.
Try to understand that _ . Some day you will discover that, despite my mistakes, I always wanted the best thing for you and that I tried to prepare the way for you. You must not feel sad, angry or impotent for seeing me near you. You must be next to me, try to understand me and to help me as I did it when you starting living. I will pay you by a smile and by the immense love I have had always for you.

I know exactly how you feel. Life as a teenager can be hard. You are not a kid anymore, because you are smart enough to observe and analyze your surroundings. However, you are still not an adult because there are still lots of experiences that you need to have and lessons that you need to learn from these experiences. To top it all, the hormonal  imbalance in your body can really mess you up emotionally. I have been there. I was in it for 6 years exploring what life is about.

438,,"Passage: You could feel sorry for Alberto Torres, who is blind. The last thing he remembers seeing was his daughter being born 13 years ago. Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenaged honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres's wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres's good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt. The dog was killed.
But Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. ""These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,"" he said. At 5 a.m. on a recent morning, we caught up with Mr. Torres at a subway stop in Brooklyn, New York, near where he lives in a third-floor apartment (with no elevator). He had been up since 3 a.m., feeding his new dog, making coffee, getting ready. ""When you're blind, it takes a little longer to do things,"" he said.
Mr. Torres was beginning his two-hour trip to his job developing film in the X-ray department of the emergency room of the Bronx hospital. He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2. He would take that to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.
It was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can't see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that everyone must do in the dark. He had to handle the long trip, as well as the work. ""Our philosophy here is that blind people can do just about anything except drive buses,"" it was the thinking about disabled people at the Bronx hospital. ""We find what a person can do rather than what he can't do,"" said the hospital's director.
One day a while ago marked the first anniversary of Mr. Torres's hiring. He developed 150 or so X-rays, his usual output, to celebrate. Mr. Torres works by himself in a small, dark room that smells of chemicals. He cannot wear gloves, because he needs to feel. It is hard work, related to emergency of lives. His immediate supervisor says he trusts him 100%. Mr. Torres makes $20,000 a year. But his motivation goes beyond money. ""If I start feeling like a victim, that makes me bitter. And why be bitter? That makes you go into a hole and stay there."" he said. ""I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary,"" insisted Mr. Torres as he quickly completed the task.

Explanation: 

The study by Harvard School of Public Health, which was published in the May 1997 issue of Alcohol Research and Health, found that the most common reason young people drink is to get drunk. In the previous year, 43 percent of college students reported that they had gotten drunk in the two weeks before the study. The researchers also found that 52 percent of college students reported getting drunk at least once in the previous year. This was up from 39 percent in 1993.

The researchers found that the most common way to get drunk was by drinking four drinks in one sitting, or a ""binge."" They also found that binge drinking was associated with being a man, having a lower education level, and living in a household with no parents. The researchers noted that the percentage of college students who reported getting drunk had increased from 1993 to 1997. The increase was most pronounced among men and those who had no parents at home.

The researchers also found that binge drinking had increased among young people who were less educated, and those who lived with their parents. The researchers noted that binge drinking was also associated with having a lower level of education, and that those who reported getting drunk were more likely to live with their parents.

""Technically, I think what they're proposing is possible,"" physicist Daniel Bonn said.
People have long puzzled over how the Egyptians moved such huge rocks. And there's no obvious answer. On average, each of the two million big stones weighed about as much as a large pickup truck. The Egyptians somehow moved the stone blocks to the pyramid site from about one kilometer away.
The most popular view is that Egyptian workers slid the blocks along smooth paths. Many scientists suspect wokers first would have put the blocks on sleds . Then they would have dragged them along paths. To make the work easier, workers may have lubricated the paths either with wet clay or with the fat from cattle. Bonn has now tested this idea by building small sleds and dragging heavy objects over sand.
Evidence from the sand supports this idea. Researchers found small amounts of fat, as well as a large amount of stone and the remains of paths.
However , physicist Joseph West think there might have been a simpler way , who led the new study . West said , ""I was inspired while watching a television program showing how sleds might have helped with pyramid construction . I thought , ""Why don't they just try rolling the things ?

Explanation: 
The Egyptian pyramids are a set of 3, 4, and 5-storey masonry structures built between 2613 BC and 2181 BC. The largest pyramid, at Giza, Egypt, was built by Pharaoh Khufu. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing. The three smaller pyramids were built for Pharaohs Khafre, Menkaure, and Khafre.

A pyramid is a three-dimensional structure with a square base and a pointed top. The top of a pyramid is called a pyramid cap. A pyramid is made up of two types of faces: front faces and back faces. The front faces are the two faces of the pyramid that are visible from the top. The back faces are the two faces that are visible from the bottom.

The pyramids were built in the form of a square or rectangle, with the sides being parallel to the ground. The sides were joined together at the corners. The base of the pyramid was a square or rectangle, with the sides being parallel to the ground. The sides were joined together at the corners. The top of the pyramid was a pyramid cap, which was a square or rectangle, with the sides being

Explanation: 
The Egyptians used to move the huge stones by sliding them along the smooth paths.
They could have rolled the stone blocks on the sand to move them to the site of the pyramids.
The sand would have made it easier to move the stones and to lubricate the path.
Bonn's test suggests that this is the way they moved the stones.
The researchers found that rolling the blocks required about as much force as moving them on a slippery path.

Question: Which of the following is not the source of lubricant for the smooth paths that Bonn used in his experiment?
A) fat
B) water
C) clay
D) muscle power

Options:
A) fat
B) water
C) clay
D) muscle power

Answer:  A

Explanation: 
Bonn's experiment involved using fat, water, and muscle power to lubricate the paths.

I have 60 million for him--- a lottery win. Please meet me. Anonymity  guaranteed.""
    Professor Sabbatucci received hundreds of calls from people hoping to trick him into handing them the cash. But there was one voice he recognized--- and he arranged to meet the man in a park. The robber, a 35-year-old unemployed father of two, gave back the suitcase and burst into tears. He could not believe what was happening. ""Why didn't you keep the money?"" he asked.

468,,"Passage: We live in a technological society where most goods are mass-produced by unskilled labor. Because of this, most people think that craft no longer exists.
One of the ways these people wrongly support their view is by pointing to 100-year-old homes which are still solid, and arguing that it is the craftsmanship that is responsible for their durability. ""Homes in those days were well-built,"" _ say. No doubt these homes were well-built, but what these people have done is mix up the quality of material used in the house with the quality of the craftsmanship.
Homes today could be built to last just as long as those old homes if people were willing or able to pay the price. For example, most people can no longer afford solid oak stairways, although they were once fairly common in older homes. Nor can they afford the high labor cost of employing a carpenter to build the stairway. Yet if someone can pay the high cost, there are still plenty of carpenters around able to make those stairways. And not only would these carpenters know how to build them, they would probably do a better job than carpenters of old.
One thing the modern carpenter has which enables him to do a better job is much more advanced tools. Such tools as laser beams and powerplanes help them lay out a house better and make more precision cuts on the wood. Also, it is not uncommon say more to find carpenters with college degrees and carpenters with a solid knowledge of mathematics, which would enable them to deal with more difficult house designs.
The problem of modern quality, then, really boils down to the problem of material, for the modern carpenter is just as able to produce craftsmanship as the carpenter of fifty years ago, but only if given proper material.

473,,"Passage: It is not a secret that these are _ times that put everyone on edge all the time and it makes people angry with their families, co-workers, friends and relatives, frustrated  and highly annoyed just for the noise of the neighbors or the music coming from the opposite house. Anger and negative energy have a strong influence on everyone's life, even when they don't realize it.
Being in a calm state of mind is simply wonderful. Results of this can be seen when parents no longer shout at their children over any small thing and when one can keep him cool when bad things happen and doesn't let the situation become worse by his negative influence.
Also results can be seen on a larger scale. In 1993 a very interesting scientific experiment called The US Transcendental Meditation experiment was conducted in Washington. A company called TM got 4,000 calm and relaxed people to simply sit and meditate   in a central Washington convention center. The results of this experiment showed that during those particular 8 weeks, violent crimes, such as murder, rape, assaults, clearly decreased by as much as 23%.
This is evident proof that meditation can change the state of mind, bring back peace of mind and collective meditation is contagious  , just as anything done collectively is contagious. For example, a person has the urge to become aggressive (while in normal circumstances that person is very calm and normal), just because he is sitting at a stadium watching a football game and everyone around is shouting and is aggressive.
Isn't increasing the quality of life worth spending 20 minutes of time on meditation? Yes, very few people follow through with a meditation method that should be a joy to do. Many start and leave it after only a few sessions.
So if collective meditation has proven that meditation works, that it calms people down and that it brings their levels of stress down, why not employ it in everyday life?

Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? 

Options:
A) Violent crimes are closely related to aggressive characters.
B) People are sometimes easily annoyed by small things.
C) Many people fail to carry out a meditation method.

Top athletes should be paid because many of them practice full time, Mark Jameson argues. Rico Cannon, a former college football player, agrees. ""Nonathletes can get a job for extra spending money, but many student athletes spend so many hours in training that they don't have time to work,"" he explains. ""Shouldn't athletes be able to earn extra money too?""
The students also make money for their schools when people buy tickets to their games. The players should receive some of that cash, supporter Robbie Pokora reasons.
College athletes are about honor and tradition, but they're also a business. Thanks to ticket sales, there's money for schools to build new athletic stadiums and give the coaches high salaries. The cash should be shared with athletes. They're the ones out on the field or court working hard for their school.
The money matter has others _ , though. Kaitlyn Rentala argues that colleges should not pay their athletes. Students are in school to get an education.

In addition, if colleges pay their athletes, those students might focus more on sports than on their education. ""Most students do not become professional athletes after college. If they focus too much on sports, they may not learn the skills they need to get good jobs,"" Kate Macrae reasons. Plus, she says, many athletes have schoolships that help them pay for school.

1. Visiting places Americans enjoy: parties, churches, restaurants, parks and sports clubs.
2. Be willing to take the first step. Don't wait for them to get close to you. Americans in China may not know you speak English. They may be uncomfortable if they can't speak your language.
3. Use small talks to open the conversation. Ask them where they're from, why they come to China, etc. . Remember: Be careful not to ask personal questions about age, salary and so on.
4. Show an interest in their culture, their country or their job. Americans like to talk about themselves!
5. Invite them to join you for dinner or just for coffee or tea. Try to set a specific time. Americans sometimes make general invitations like ""Let's go out for dinner sometime. ""Often this is just a way to be friendly. It is not always a real invitation.
6. Don't expect too much at first. Maybe they're being friendly. But maybe they want to be your good friends. It will take time to tell.

But Michael didn't choose to be a victim. He chose to be in a good mood. He chose to be in a good mood because he knew that his daughter was going to be fine. He chose to be in a good mood because he knew that if he didn't have a good attitude, he would be a victim.

Hot job: TV Weatherman
Where: ABC-TV, New York City
When you were a child, did you plan to forecast wind, rain, and snow on TV?
I wanted to be a foreign journalist. I took courses in weather science at Eastern Kentucky University, but I majored in broadcasting news.
How did you finally become a weatherman?
My first job in the early 1980s was at the local TV station in Paducah, Kentucky. I did everything from turning on the lights in the morning to writing and delivering morning news. I put together weather forecasts, and became interested in them.
Back then, how did you forecast weather?
Independent companies collected computer information that showed, for example, how a single weather system might split into snow or snow mixed with rain. The information was often opposite and the job of a weatherman was to study the information and make the best educated guess about the storm.
Has weather forecasting changed much with new technology?
Advanced computers, satellites, and Doppler radar (sound waves used to track storms) have made forecasting more exact. But we still know very little about how weather is shaped. So far, we just have theories.
Any advice for children who'd like to become weather scientists?
To me, weather is the most exciting field in the world. There are still so many more questions about weather than answers. After all, if we can't foresee floods or hurricanes, how safe a society are we? Weather forecasting is wide open for scientists who love to solve puzzling problems. The next generation of meteorologists (weather scientists) will unlock many of Earth's weather secrets. So get a general knowledge of Earth science, and study meteorology in college.

493,,"Passage: Warm weather brought by El Nino has had mixed effects on animals in usually snowy places in North America, including New England, according to an Associated Press article.
Some animals seem to benefit from having a chance to gather more food before winter, and from expending less energy in daily survival mode. Others, like snowshoe hares, are put at center stage in predators'  view when they lack snow for disguising their white fur -- not a good thing for them, of course.
Black bears, on the other hand, have been keeping busy gathering nuts and apples, when they would normally have settled into their winter homes by now. Vermont and Massachusetts officials have asked residents to wait till snow falls to take out their bird feeders for the sake of safety, the article said.
""We suggest waiting for 6 or more inches of snow that lasts before taking out your bird feeders, especially if you have been visited in the past by bears or if there are sightings of bears in your neighborhood,""Forrest Hammond, Vermont Fish and Wildlife's bear biologist, said in the article.""Due to lack of snow and frozen ground, birds are able to seek food in fields and forests for theirnatural foods.""
Snow amounts can also determine how comfortable bears are and how quickly they consume their accumulated fat during hibernation , noted Hammond in the article. This is because snow covers and traps them in their winter homes, and also hides them from predators.

Question: What may upset snowshoe hares because of El Nino? 

Options:
A) Their being caught more easily.

C) Their consuming more energy.
D) Their losing sight of their enemies.


Choose the correct answer and conclude with 'The answer is: <A/B/C/D>'. 

Answer: ","D
B
A

Explanation: Snowshoe hares are small, white animals with long legs. They have a wide range in North America, from Alaska to Mexico, and are found in most of the northern states and provinces of Canada.

The hares eat a wide variety of foods, including grasses, herbs, and flowers, as well as acorns and berries. They are often found in places where snow is scarce, and they hibernate in the winter in dens that they dig in the snow. They are active in the spring, when they look for food.

During the spring and summer, snowshoe hares are often seen as predators on other animals. They are often seen chasing small birds or other animals, and sometimes they kill them. In some areas, the hares' numbers are controlled by hunters.

When the hares do not have enough food to survive the winter, they may not have enough energy to stay warm and they may not be able to find food in the spring. This can cause them to die of starvation. If there is not enough food in the spring, the hares may die of starvation.

Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album.The German artist Joachim Schmid,who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"",has gathered discarded photographs,postcards and newspaper images since 1982.In his on-going project,Archiv,he groups photographs of family life according to themes:people with dogs;teams;new cars;dinner with the family;and so on.

Since all activities remain interesting for only so long, too much homework can lead to ennui. So, why are some kids getting homework overload? Teachers give two reasons. First, they say, the government now requires schools to meet higher-than-ever achievement goals for students. If students don' t succeed, the school faces punishment. Second, many parents want their children to be able to get into the best colleges and universities. These parents believe homework is a way to ensure that students are learning as much as possible.
People who favor homework argue that it can have many beneficial effects. They claim it can help students develop good study habits. Homework can help students recognize that learning can occur at home as well as at school. It can help develop their independent learning and responsible character traits .
But studies show that middle school students doing 60 to 90 minutes of homework a night are doing just as well in school as those doing more than 90 minutes. And homework can have negative effects. Homework can deny students access to leisure  activities that also teach important skills.

They can put too much pressure on their kids.

Choose the correct answer and conclude with 'The answer is: <A/B/C/D>'. 

Answer: ","A

Explanation: 
The answer is: A.

A study done by the U.S. Department of Education found that homework was beneficial for kids in grades 3 through 6. It found that students who did homework in these grades did better on tests than those who did not. It also found that the more homework kids did, the better they did on tests.
The study also found that homework can be a good thing for kids. It can help them learn, and it can also help them develop good study habits.
It also found that homework can have negative effects. It can be too much, and it can also be too little. Too much homework can be bad for kids, because it can cause them to get bored and unmotivated. Too little homework can be bad for kids, because it can cause them to not get enough practice and can make them feel like they are not learning enough.
The bottom line is that homework can be a good thing for kids. It can help them learn and develop good study habits. But it can also have negative effects, such as too much or too little. So the answer is: A. Homework helps students to succeed.

527,,"Passage: Are you having too much salt? You might not think so, but people in China eat on average   about 12 grams of salt each day, that is much higher than the 6 grams suggested by the World Health Organization. You could be eating too much without realizing it, because about 75% of the salt we eat is already in the food we buy, such as bread, sauces, soups and sausages.
What problems can eating too much salt cause? To answer that question, first let's take a look at what salt is.
Salt is a chemical compound. It is made of sodium   and chloride  . Salt is used to keep and flavor foods. A small amount of salt is important for good health because our bodies need sodium and chloride to work.
But past studies have found that people who eat more salt than they need tend to have high blood pressure. Eating too much salt has also been connected with other conditions, such as heart and kidney   problems.
If you want to cut down on salt, the good news is, there are plenty of simple things to do. Here are some tips:
*Cut back on high salt foods.
Most foods contain some salt. But some foods such as cheese, bacon, pickles  , smoked fish and chips are almost always high in salt because of the way they are made. You can still enjoy them, but try to have these in smaller amounts, or eat them less often.
*Choose reduced salt bread and breakfast cereals.
Bread and breakfast cereals   are major source of salt in the diet, not that they're necessarily high in salt but because we eat a lot of them. For these foods, there can be a really big difference between different types and brands. So next time you're shopping, take the time to compare the salt levels on a few similar products. And always try to choose the ones lower in salt.
*Avoid adding salt to cooking and at table. Instead, you could use herbs and spices   such as garlic   and lemon juice to add flavor to meals.

Question: Many people in China don't realize they are eating too much salt because   _  . 

Options:
A) salty food tasted better than reduced salt food
B) they do not calculate the amount of salt they eat
C) about 3/4 of the salt we eat is already in the food we buy
D) few people experience problems from eating too much salt

Explanation:  China is the world's largest consumer of salt. China is a country where people eat a lot of food. This means they eat a lot of salt. People in China eat on average 12 grams of salt a day. This is much higher than the 6 grams of salt the World Health Organization recommends for healthy adults. 

People in China also eat a lot of food that is high in salt. This includes bacon, cheese, pickles, smoked fish and chips. 

People in China can cut down on salt by choosing low-salt products and by cutting back on high-salt foods. 

People in China can also reduce their salt intake by eating more often. 

People in China can also reduce their salt intake by eating more often.
C
C
B
D

Explanation: 
There are many reasons why people in China eat too much salt. One reason is that they don't realize they are eating too much. Another reason is that they don't calculate the amount of salt they eat. They also don't know how to choose foods with less salt. And lastly, they don't know how to avoid high salt foods.

Passage: Are you having too much salt? You might not think so, but people in China eat on average   about 12 grams of salt each day, that is much higher than the 6 grams suggested by the World Health Organization. You could be eating too much without realizing it, because about 75% of the salt we eat is already in the food we buy, such as bread, sauces, soups and sausages.
What problems can eating too much salt cause? To answer that question, first let's take a look at what salt is.
Salt is a chemical compound. It is made of sodium   and chloride . Salt is used to keep and flavor foods. A small amount of salt is important for good health because our bodies need sodium and chloride to work.
But past studies have found that people who eat more salt than they need tend to have high blood pressure.

But past studies have found that people who eat more salt than they need tend to have high blood pressure. Eating too much salt has also been connected with other conditions, such as heart and kidney   problems.
If you want to cut down on salt, the good news is, there are plenty of simple things to do. Here are some tips:
*Cut back on high salt foods.
Most foods contain some salt. But some foods such as cheese, bacon, pickles  , smoked fish and chips are almost always high in salt because of the way they are made. You can still enjoy them, but try to have these in smaller amounts, or eat them less often.
*Choose reduced salt bread and breakfast cereals.
Bread and breakfast cereals   are major source of salt in the diet, not that they're necessarily high in salt but because we eat a lot of them. For these foods, there can be a really big difference between different types and brands. So next time you're shopping, take the time to compare the salt levels on a few similar products. And always try to choose the ones lower in salt.
*Avoid adding salt to cooking and at table. Instead, you could use herbs and spices   such as garlic   and lemon juice to add flavor to meals.

537,,"Passage: It was 11 pm. Donald Lubeck was lying in bed. Outside, lightning lit up the sky, and thunder shook the house. Suddenly he heard the smoke alarm sounding. Lubeck walked down to see what happened; he opened the door to the kitchen, and flames  just went out. The sudden strong wind from the doorway immediately created a large fire from a small one, probably caused by lightning. Lubeck went back to his bedroom to call 911. ""I felt safe because the room had a separate stairway,"" he explains. The phone didn't work, and when Lubeck tried to go down the stairway, he was stopped by a wall of flames. Lubeck realized he was in trouble. His daughter and granddaughters, who lived with him, were away for the night. 
Up a hill lived Lubeck's neighbors, Jeremie Wentworth and his wife. From his house, Wentworth saw the black smoke. He rushed out, and headed towards Lubeck's house. He knew Lubeck lived in the house. He dialed 911. On the phone, the 911 worker warned Wentworth not to enter the house. ""But I told the worker, ""Sorry, but I'm going in. I can hear Lubeck shouting ""Help me!"" I can't let myself do nothing in this situation,"" /he says. ""I went in and shouted, ""Donald, where are you?"" Then I had to run outside to catch my breath."" After one more try inside the house, he gave up. Then the wind parted the smoke just enough for him to see Lubeck on the second-floor bedroom. But there was no way to get to him.""I finally noticed a ladder,"" says Wentworth. He set it against the wall and pulled Lubeck down. Just seconds later the floor fell down. 
Within the year, Lubeck and his family built a new two-story house at the place. Wentworth and Lubeck don't run into each other often, but Lubeck now knows that if he ever needs help, Wentworth will be there.

Question: Why did Lubeck feel safe at the beginning? 

Options:
A) Because he knew how to fight fire.
B) Because he thought it was a small fire.
C) Because he thought he could get out easily.

""I felt safe because the room had a separate stairway,"" he explains. The phone didn't work, and when Lubeck tried to go down the stairway, he was stopped by a wall of flames. Lubeck realized he was in trouble. His daughter and granddaughters, who lived with him, were away for the night. 
Up a hill lived Lubeck's neighbors, Jeremie Wentworth and his wife. From his house, Wentworth saw the black smoke. He rushed out, and headed towards Lubeck's house. He knew Lubeck lived in the house. He dialed 911. On the phone, the 911 worker warned Wentworth not to enter the house. ""But I told the worker, ""Sorry, but I'm going in. I can hear Lubeck shouting ""Help me!"" I can't let myself do nothing in this situation,"" /he says. ""I went in and shouted, ""Donald, where are you?"" Then I had to run outside to catch my breath."" After one more try inside the house, he gave up. Then the wind parted the smoke just enough for him to see Lubeck on the second-floor bedroom. But there was no way to get to him.""I finally noticed a ladder,"" says Wentworth. He set it against the wall and pulled Lubeck down. Just seconds later the floor fell down. 
Within the year, Lubeck and his family built a new two-story house at the place. Wentworth and Lubeck don't run into each other often, but Lubeck now knows that if he ever needs help, Wentworth will be there.

Explanation: 
This is a tricky question.
It is not the easiest to answer because there is not one correct answer.
The answer is: 'one never loses anything by politeness'.
The reason for this is because the question is asking about the consequences of one's actions.

Special-education teachers Kim Chevalier and Sue Casey introduced the Dixie PIT from a similar  program at Kennesaw Mountain High School in Georgia.
Not that it was easy. Chevalier's first problem to overcome was product-related. Should schools be selling coffee? What about sugar content?
Kenton County Food Service Director Ginger Gray helped. She made sure all the drinks, which use non-fat milk, fell within nutrition   guidelines.
The whole school has joined in to help.
Teachers agreed to give up their l ounge   in the mornings. Art students painted the name of the shop on the wall. Business students designed the paychecks. The basketball team helped pay for cups.

Well, imagine how my sister felt when she went off for the first time to New York for a business trip. After a few days she was still amazed at how friendly everyone was to her until she took a taxi back to her hotel one night. First she gave just the name of the hotel, but when asked she said the address too. Then she was asked how to get there, but of course she didn't know. Imagine how frightened she was when the driver started shouting at her for not knowing the way.
The UK
A friend was in London for a conference. He took a taxi and there were no problems: the driver knew the way and was very cheerful. The problem started when he realized he had stupidly left his laptop on the back seat! He called the company up and, in a panic, went straightaway to their Lost and Found office. He was _ to find the laptop waiting for him, and then very surprised that it was one of 2,900 left in taxis over the past six months!
Tunisia
Well, my brother took a Mediterranean cruise  one summer and had a day in Tunis. He spent most of the afternoon in the Medina buying presents when he suddenly realized he'd completely lost track of time and there was only half an hour before the ship left the port. There had been loads of yellow taxis in the centre so he wasn't too bothered until he stood on the pavement and waited for one to appear----and of course there wasn't a single one in sight! Nothing! He questioned a passer-by who explained that the cost for the taxi ride goes up in the evening so the taxi drivers disappear until they can charge higher prices! Luckily for my brother the man then offered to give him a lift and he caught the boat on time!

Researchers at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, southern. England, have shown that animals have a good memory system and are extremely good at recognizing faces--which they think is a sure sign of intelligence.
Behavioral scientist Keith Kendrick and his friends trained 20 sheep to recognize and distinguish  25 pairs of sheep faces and used electrodes  to measure their brain activity, which showed they could remember 50 faces for up to two years.
""If they can do that with faces, the fact is that they have to have reasonable intelligence, otherwise, what is the point of having a system for remembering anything else,"" Kendrick said in an interview.
So hours of seemingly mindless eating grass may not be so mindless after all.
Kendrick believes sheep got their reputation as dumb animals because they live in large groups and do not appear to have much ind
ividuality and are frightened of just about everything.
All animals, including humans, once they are frightened don't tend to show signs of intelligent action,"" he explained.
In research reported in the science journal Nature, Kendrick and his team showed that sheep, like humans, have a specialized system in the brain, which allows them to distinguish between many different faces that look extremely similar.
""The most important findings of the study is that they are able, both from a behavioral point of view and from looking at the way the brain is organized, to remember a large number of faces of individuals for a very long time,"" said Kendrick. ""It is a very strange system. They are showing similar abilities in many ways to humans. ""

572,,"Passage: In 1955, a man named Raymond Kroc entered a partnership with two brothers named Mcdonald. They operated a popular restaurant in California which sold food that was easy to prepare and serve quickly. Hamburgers, French fries, and cold drinks were the main foods on the limited menu. Kroc opened similar eating places under the same name, ""McDonald's"" and they were a quick success. He later took over the company and today it is one of the most famous and successful ""fast-food"" chains  in America and the world.
Why was his idea so successful? Probably the most important reason was that his timing was right. In the 1950s, most married women stayed home to keep house and take care of their children. During the 1960s, the movement for equality  between men and women and an economy  that needed more families to have two money-earners resulted in many women returning to the workplace. This meant that they had less time and energy to do housework, so they depended more on fast-food restaurants.
Single parents also have little time to spend in the kitchen. People living alone because of divorce  or a preference for a ""single lifestyle"" also depend on this type of food, since cooking for one is often more trouble than it is worth.
Fast food is not part of the diet of all Americans. Another of the 1960s was called back-to-nature movement. More and more Americans based their diets on natural foods. This preference for natural foods continues to this day. These products can now be found not only in the special health food store but also in many supermarkets.

He is a new employee with little experience and so his attitude towards his job was over enthusiastic and he lacked proper judgment.
We are by no means excusing his behavior but I would like to request you not to take any legal action against the company as we are very sorry for what happened. To express our appreciation, please accept the offer of free servicing of all products of our company that you own for up to three years.

I should like to apologize for the inconvenience caused to you due to poor Internet connectivity. I understand that you require the Internet all through the day as all your business deals are done online and since last week your work has been affected a great deal.
We are continually working towards providing the best possible services to our customers. You have been using our service for the last three years and are aware of the excellent quality of service offered by us. However, this time due to some major technical fault the Internet service was interrupted and our customers in your part of the city are facing our poor Internet connectivity problems.
The issue is likely to be solved within the next two days; kindly bear with us until then. Once again I apologize for the poor service.
                                                           Yours faithfully,

Doctor Ndiaye says babies who weigh less than two kilos get special attention from _ who assist with the births. They teach the mother how to keep the baby wrapped to her chest. The health center has a Kangaroo Clinic, a special area for teaching this method.

In REM sleep, the brain waves are very different from the NREM waves. They are a mixture of alpha and beta waves. The alpha waves are the most common. They are usually 8-12 cycles per second. These waves are slow and easy to see. The alpha waves are very similar to those seen in daydreaming. The beta waves are faster and are the most common in REM sleep. They are 12-30 cycles per second. These waves are also easy to see. The alpha and beta waves are the same as those seen in daydreaming.

Insomniacs are persons who have trouble getting into sleep at night. Insomnia is a condition where one has trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.

Explanation: NREM sleep is divided into four stages (N1-N4). The first stage is light sleep and the last one is deep sleep. During deep sleep, we do not remember anything that we have been thinking about, but we can still dream. People usually have 4-5 REM periods in one night. REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement. It is a state of rapid eye movement during which we dream. During this stage, our eyes move rapidly from side to side. It is in this stage that we dream the most. The most common dream is a nightmare.

We have decided to camp because it does not cost as much as vacationing   in hotels.
We have to plan very carefully in advance. First, the car we are going to drive is very small, so we have decided to take only one small suitcase each and as few camping things as possible. We will take some medicine with us to prevent insects   from hurting us, and also food for picnics. Second, there is a lot to see in the United States and Canada, so we have to decide on the direction   we want to drive.

We want to climb in the mountains, visit famous caves, and swim in cool mountain rivers. We want to visit many cities and talk to many people, which I am sure can enrich our experience greatly. We also want to find a hotel room if it rains at night. We expect to have an exciting trip.

593,,"Passage: In most of the time, I am devoted to my research in the lab with my friend Dave, who loves traveling very much. To make our life colorful and relax ourselves, in July, my friend and I are taking a camping trip. We will travel for four weeks and will tour the United States and part of Canada. We have decided to camp because it does not cost as much as vacationing   in hotels.
We have to plan very carefully in advance. First, the car we are going to drive is very small, so we have decided to take only one small suitcase each and as few camping things as possible. We will take some medicine with us to prevent insects   from hurting us, and also food for picnics. Second, there is a lot to see in the United States and Canada, so we have to decide on the direction   we want to drive.
The date we are leaving is July 2, from which day we will have two months off.  We want to see and do many things on our camping tour. We want to climb in the mountains, visit famous caves, and swim in cool mountain rivers. We want to visit many cities and talk to many people, which I am sure can enrich our experience greatly. We also want to find a hotel room if it rains at night. We expect to have an exciting trip.

For years we made the long drive from our home in Seattle to my parents' home in Boise in nine hours.We traveled the way most people do:the fastest,shortest,easiest road,especially when I was alone with four noisy,restless kids who hate confinement   and have strong opinions about everything.
Road trips felt risky,so I would drive fast,stopping only when I had to.We would stick to the freeways and arrive tired.
But then Banner,our lamb was born.He was rejected by his mama days before our planned trip to Boise.I had two choices:leave Banner with my husband,or take him with me.My husband made the decision for me.
That is how I found myself on the road with four kids,a baby lamb and nothing but my everlasting optimism to see me through.We took the country roads out of necessity.We had to stop every hour,let Banner shake out his legs and feed him.The kids chased him and one another.They'd get back in the car breathless and energized,smelling fresh from the cold air.
We explored side roads,catching grasshoppers in waisthigh grass.Even if we simply looked out of the car windows at baby pigs following their mother,or fish leaping out of the water,it was better than the best ride down the freeway.Here was life.And new horizons  .
We eventually arrived at my parents' doorstep astonishingly fresh and full of stories.
I grew brave with the trip back home and creative with my disciplining technique.On an empty section of road,everyone started quarreling.I stopped the car,ordered all kids out and told them to meet me up ahead.I parked my car half a mile away and read my book in sweet silence.
Some road trips are by necessity fast and straight.But that trip with Banner opened our eyes to a world available to anyone adventurous enough to wander around and made me realize that a detour may uncover the best part of a journey-and the best part of yourself.

Speed dating
It's exactly what the name implies. Complete with a timer, a whistle and 50 willing singles, speed dating is not the traditional dinner and a movie type of first date. Singles pay US $35 for three minutes with more than two dozen future dates. They ask questions and try to get to know each other. At the sound of a whistle, they do the same thing all over again--25 times in all.
Lock and key party
Women are given a lock and men are given a key, upon arriving at the party. Each key and lock has several matches. One can hunt for his/her later-to-be sweetheart in various groups, and try out the key or lock. Each time a lock and key match the pair are entered into a ballot  for top prizes!
Dinner in the dark
Waiters wearing night vision glasses guide the guests through the pitch-black dining room. They are seated at the table and familiarized with the wine glass and plate. Food is handled with the fingers. People will not see the food they are eating or the guests at their table until the dessert course. At that moment, dining partners will appear.
Message party
Have A Cocktail, Leave A Message! When you arrive, you get a tag with a number and a pad of post-it notes. If you see someone you like, write a message on the message board. But wait...

Mexican Whiteboy, by Matt de la Pena, is about a teenager's search for identity. It was named as one of the Top Ten Best Books for Young Adults in 2009 by the US Young Adult Library Services Association.
When Lopez's mother decides to go to live with her wealthy white boyfriend in San Francisco, he chooses to spend the summer with his father's family in San Diego. It's a trip to explore roots and self-identity, filled with unexpected friendship.
There he meets Uno, of mixed heritage   like himself, also with a divorced mom. Uno understands Danny's split background and helps him improve his baseball skills. Both boys have big league dreams, but they both have to learn to come to terms with their mixed heritages before they can achieve their goals.
Aside from discussions of racism, Mexican Whiteboy takes on other issues, such as the importance of family and the negative influence of hiding the truth. It also shows how sports can draw cultures together.

C

Explanation: 
The reason Lopez finds it hard to fit in is because he has mixed heritage and is half-Mexican and half-white. He has two different cultures and that makes him different from both sides. He needs to find out who he is and where he belongs before he can achieve his goals.

Clare Short knows it. Every developing economist knows it. The World Bank knows it. The education of girls is the surest way to reduce poverty.
The reason is simple. All the evidence shows that taking girls out of the fields and homes, and putting them behind desks, raises economic productivity, lowers infant and maternal  death rates, reduces birth rates, and improves environmental management.
Why, then, are 90 million primary school-age girls around the world not in school? For the same reason that when Charles Dickens was writing David Copperfield 150 years ago girls were absent from the British education system: Men in power mostly prefer _ that way, or are not interested enough in changing the situation to commit energy and money to doing so.
The countries with the poorest record for having women in positions of power or influence have the worst figures for girls' education. High-profile intervention  by organizations such as the World Bank has begun successfully with several countries, and more of the same will probably be needed to bring change in conservative, male-run states.
Even if there were no development payoff from gender equality in schools, the education of girls would still be a cause worth fighting for. Education is a human right, and the denial of it to girls is a scar on the community in the twenty-first century.
To be born a girl in a rural area in Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Morocco, Togo, or Sudan -- half a dozen of the most shameful performers -- means being condemned to a life without school, education, or clean water, marriage and babies coming too early, too many births, children who die of preventable diseases, backbreaking work in the fields, subordination  to husband and his family, and an early death.
Every year, almost 12 million children under the age of five needlessly die of infectious diseases associated with poverty. But each additional year spent by their mothers in primary school lowers the risk of premature child deaths by about 8 percent. In Pakistan, an extra year of school for 1,000 girls could prevent sixty infant deaths.
With women and girls being the main farmers in Africa and southern Asia, their education offers a chance to develop more efficient farming practices, improve output, and raise awareness of the ecological needs of the land with tree planting and farming. Therefore, the world community cannot afford to ignore this avenue of change.

Question: How many more infants will survive when 100 girls stay in school for another year? 

Options:
A) 5
B) 6
C) 8
D) 12


Choose the correct answer and conclude with 'The answer is: <A/B/C/D>'. 

Answer: ","12


Explanation: 
For each extra year of schooling, the risk of dying before the age of 5 decreases by 8%. If we assume that the girls who died in the first year of school would have been alive today had they remained in school, then the number of deaths prevented would be 12.
12


Explanation: 

The answer is 12. Each year, 12 million children under the age of five needlessly die of infectious diseases associated with poverty. But each additional year spent by their mothers in primary school lowers the risk of premature child deaths by about 8 percent. In Pakistan, an extra year of school for 1,000 girls could prevent sixty infant deaths.
12
12

Explanation:

The answer is 12

The problem says that each additional year spent by their mothers in primary school lowers the risk of premature child deaths by about 8 percent. So, 100 girls will reduce 100*8=800 premature child deaths.

Answer: D

8
12

Explanation:
6

Explanation: 
Girls who stay in school are 4 times more likely to get married later in life. If a girl stays in school for another year, her risk of getting married at age 18 is reduced by 20%. This means that if 100 girls stay in school for another year, 20 more girls will get married at age 18, and 40 more will be married later in life. Therefore, the answer is C.
B
8

Explanation:

The correct answer is 8. The number of additional infant deaths avoided is 8. Since 100 girls stay in school for another year, 8 babies will be saved.
C
8
12
C
12

Explanation: 

In the last question, we were given the option to choose an answer and then to calculate the answer. 
The correct answer is 12. 
A child who stays in school for 1 year will save 8 lives, 
so 100 girls who stay in school for 1 year will save 8*100=800 lives. 
The question was about how many more lives will be saved if 100 girls stay in school for another year.
So, 800+12=812 lives will be saved if 100 girls stay in school for another year.

Even if there were no development payoff from gender equality in schools, the education of girls would still be a cause worth fighting for. Education is a human right, and the denial of it to girls is a scar on the community in the twenty-first century.
To be born a girl in a rural area in Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Morocco, Togo, or Sudan -- half a dozen of the most shameful performers -- means being condemned to a life without school, education, or clean water, marriage and babies coming too early, too many births, children who die of preventable diseases, backbreaking work in the fields, subordination  to husband and his family, and an early death.
Every year, almost 12 million children under the age of five needlessly die of infectious diseases associated with poverty. But each additional year spent by their mothers in primary school lowers the risk of premature child deaths by about 8 percent. In Pakistan, an extra year of school for 1,000 girls could prevent sixty infant deaths.
With women and girls being the main farmers in Africa and southern Asia, their education offers a chance to develop more efficient farming practices, improve output, and raise awareness of the ecological needs of the land with tree planting and farming. Therefore, the world community cannot afford to ignore this avenue of change.

Question: What does the author think of girls' education? 

Options:
A) essential
B) terrible
C) indifferent
D) helpless


Choose the correct answer and conclude with 'The answer is: <A/B/C/D>'. 

Answer: ","A
B
A

Explanation: The author says that all the evidence shows that taking girls out of the fields and homes, and putting them behind desks, raises economic productivity, lowers infant and maternal death rates, reduces birth rates, and improves environmental management.  Therefore, the world community cannot afford to ignore this avenue of change.
D

Explanation: 

The author is talking about the need to educate girls, not about the need to educate all girls. Girls can also be educated, but it is not as important as educating boys. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
C
A

Explanation:  A) essential: Girls are the main source of income in Africa and South Asia. Without them, the countries will be in serious trouble.  B) terrible: It is a terrible thing to deny a girl education.  C) indifferent: It is indifferent because the author does not think of it as a very important issue.  D) helpless: It is helpless because it is difficult to do something about the problem.
C

Explanation: 
The answer is C. 
The passage states that the education of girls is the surest way to reduce poverty. 
It also states that men in power mostly prefer that way or are not interested enough in changing the situation to commit energy and money to doing so. 
Therefore, the education of girls is a cause worth fighting for.

624,,"Passage: British newspapers are among the oldest and most famous in the world. But recently big changes have seen these traditional publications try to fit the modern world. After 221 years, The Times has changed its size to become much smaller. In fact, the paper has cut its size in half from a broadsheet to tabloid . 
In prefix = st1 /Britainthe newspaper market is divided between the larger broadsheets and the smaller tabloids. These terms refer to the size of the papers' pages but there is also a clear difference in content. Broadsheets such as The Times, the Guardian and Daily Telegraph are serious papers. They cover a broad range of political, economic and international issues. Their stories are also reasonably long and use quite formal language.
Tabloids have far more stories about less serious issues such as celebrities' love lives. Their stories are shorter and use more simple language. Tabloids often have bigger pictures. Britain's best-selling newspaper, the Sun, is a tabloid and has a naked girl on Page Three every day.
By changing to the size of a tabloid, The Times is following in the footsteps of a less famous broadsheet paper the Independent . It changed to tabloid last year and saw its sales increase greatly. Although both papers have switched to the smaller size the content of the papers has remained the same. They are both still serious papers. 
The two papers claim that people find the smaller size easier to handle when they travel to work on the bus or the train in the morning. Instead of calling the new style of their paper tabloid, the paper says its new size is ""compact"" .

629,,"Passage: In the US and Britain, the slogan around colleges was ""Save water. Shower with a friend."" Now, Wuhan University has come up with another system for the campus bathhouse. It charges students for the amount of time in a shower. Before entering the bathhouse, students pay for the amount of time they want in the shower with cash or their student ID card. The clock starts ticking the minute the tape is turned on. It pauses when a button is pressed for soap. An integrated circuit (IC) card reader at each tap shows the time. No money, no water. The benefits of the new system can be seen with the old system, which charged 1 Yuan for each person regardless of time in the shower. The university used about 320 tons of water daily under the old system, but only 160 tons now.
Many students use the new system but opinions on it are divided. Some students say it is bad because bathing had become a sort of race. Many people using it for the first time are not sure how long they need to shower. Some might be embarrassed if their time is up and they're still covered in soap. They have to ask the bathhouse worker to help them buy extra time.
""It's a _ in the system that you can not buy extra time on the ID card,"" said Ren, a freshman in Wuhan University. The university is also considering some students' suggestions that they be allowed to pay after they've finished the shower. Not surprisingly, some are complaining about losing the hour shower. But many students say the move helps them develop a water-saving sense.
Without the time limits, most students tended to shower for 30 to an hour in the bathhouse.
Some even used the hot water to wash their clothes. ""In my experience, 10--20 minutes is enough,"" said Dai Zhihua, a third-year student who usually takes 8 minutes.
A similar system has been installed in other universities. Shanghai Normal University introduced it at its Fengxiang Campus in September. The bathing fee there is 0.2 Yuan per minute. One male student responded by setting a record with a two-minute shower.

""Taking care of the dog's waste can also help to develop children's sense of responsibility!""
As to protecting water resources, the Australian government has made strict rules for families. Julie says, ""We certainly would not use tap water to water the flowers!"" She says almost every family in her community has a huge tank used to store rainwater, which is later used as the resource of all outdoor water use, including car washing and watering the garden. This year, they also asked people to connect the water tank with their toilets.

Far from preventing festivals and fun,the Victorians,who invented photography,also created Christmas as a celebration as it is today. So the severity of people in the 19th-century photographs cannot be the evidence of generalized sadness. This was not a society in permanent desperation. Instead,the true answer has to do with attitudes to portraiture itself.
People who sat for early photographs understood it as a significant moment. Sitting for the camera was cheaper,quicker and meant that people who never had a chance to be painted could now be photographed; but people seemed to have taken it seriously in the same way they would be a painted portrait.

To me those unsmiling people probably had as much fun as we do,if not more. But they felt no need to prove it with pictures. Instead,when whey sat for a photograph,they thought about time,death and memory. Perhaps we should stop smiling sometimes,too.

Explanation: 

In the past, dogs were used to help people. They could be trained to take messages, to go to a house and tell the owner who the dog was and what the dog could do. They could also be trained to go to the hospital and tell the doctor who the dog was and what the dog could do. This way, the doctor could get the message and the dog could get the medicine or a new toy or whatever the dog wanted. Nowadays, people still use dogs to help, but it is for different reasons. They help people with disabilities. For example, a dog can help a child who has polio or has a spinal cord injury. The dog can help the child get around, play with other children, and go to the doctor. The dog can also help the child take messages to and from the doctor and tell the doctor what the child needs.

668,,"Passage: Since people first sent rockets into space in the 1950s, we have been leaving behind all sorts of things. Some of them, like the camera, were lost by astronauts while they did work outside their spaceship. But much of the space junk is made up of little pieces of things that were once bigger objects, until they struck each other and broke apart.
Some things we send into space fall back toward the earth and burn up in the atmosphere. But larger pieces sometimes survive the extreme heat and hit the ground or the ocean at great speeds. So there is always concern that something may fall from the sky and do some harm.
But space junk falling on housetops   is not the biggest worry. Scientists are concerned about what happens when an empty rocket strikes another while orbiting   the earth. Two big things become many smaller things. They then hit other things. The pieces get smaller and smaller until they form a cloud of junk that blocks the path of future space vehicles.
So what can be done to clean up the space around our planet? Marco Castronuovo, an Italian researcher, talks about sending a satellite into space that would get very close to some of the larger pieces of space junk. The satellite would connect a small rocket to the useless object. When the rocket explodes, it pushes the junk into a lower and slower orbit, nearer the earth. After a time, the junk burns up in the atmosphere.
Mr. Castronuovo has proposed   using a number of small satellites with robotic arms. One arm would catch the space junk, and another arm would connect the rocket. He imagines that each satellite would jump from one large piece of junk to another. He thinks this method could destroy about ten large objects each year.
Scientists have been concerned about space junk for many years. Right now, the costs of the clean-up have been too great. Mr. Castronuovo says his system could be put in place for a much more reasonable amount of money.

Explanation: 
The answer is:  A.

In the passage, Marco Castronuovo proposes a system to clean up the space around our planet. He thinks it would be a great idea. The passage says he is not proposing a system that would destroy all space junk. Instead, he is proposing a system that would destroy a large amount of junk each year. The passage also says that the system would cost a lot of money. But this cost would be much less than the cost of cleaning up all the space junk in the world.
The passage also says that scientists have been concerned about space junk for many years. This is because scientists have known about space junk for many years. But the cost of cleaning up space junk has been too great for many years. The passage says that Marco Castronuovo is proposing a system that would be a good way to clean up space junk. The passage also says that Marco Castronuovo's system could be put in place for a much more reasonable amount of money.

Microsoft education director Suzi Levine says the nine-year-old program began mainly as a competition to create technology.
SUZI LEVINE: ""When we realized that students really actually want to have a purpose for what they're creating, we introduced the idea of inspiring them with the UN Millennium Development Goals and suggesting that they use those for their muse . ""This past year we also rolled out something called the Imagine Cup Solve This library , where IGOs, NGOs and nonprofits can submit some of the technical challenges that they would like students to consider for their solutions.""
Microsoft says over 350,000 high school and college students registered for this year's competition. Judges chose more than four hundred of them to attend the finals.
SUZI LEVINE: ""One from Thailand was called NewKrean, where they created a Windows Phone 7 application that allows you to broadcast your location to your social network of friends so that you can be more easily rescued."" They named their application Terra.
Suzi Levine says there were also ideas from Egypt inspired by the revolution that _ president Hosni Mubarak in February.
SUZI LEVINE: ""One was to use Bluetooth as sort of a Twitter equivalent so that if the government shuts down the Internet, you actually can still have a massive social distribution.""
Students competed in nine categories. For example, in software design the top prize of twenty-five thousand dollars went to Team Hermes from Ireland. The students developed a device for cars to collect information on road conditions, driving behavior and traffic incidents.
A team from Taiwan's National Tsing Hua University won first place in the embedded  development category. They developed a network of wireless devices to help plot the safest escape routes during a fire.

Something as simple as toothpaste contains at least three chemicals, if not more. It is the mixture of them and its chemical reaction that keeps your teeth clean. Other things you use every day are created by chemistry, such as hair products, shampoo and soap. Adding detergent   to water involves chemistry. Without chemistry, we would never have known that we need soap to get the oil out of clothes or skin. Chemistry not only helps us make products for use, but it also helps us understand the world around us. Chemistry helps us understand what the ozone layer   is and how it protects us.
Chemistry also gives us sunscreen to protect us from the sun. Thanks to chemistry, we know bleach   can't be mixed with vinegar, because it can produce _ gas. Without chemistry, we wouldn't have fireworks displays on important days.
Chemistry plays a big role in food preparation. Cooking food causes it to go through a chemical change. That is why cooked food often tastes different from raw food. Baking is a great example of chemistry. Too much or too little of any ingredient makes a difference to the result of baking, for example, the dough   won't rise or the cake will be flat.

681,,"Passage: For the first time in Hong Kong's history, an entertainer has been written into middle school textbooks. He is considered one of the best actors in Hong Kong. Yes, he is Chow Yun-fat.
The example of his long hard struggle for success has been used in a chapter in a Hong Kong middle school textbook. Using his experience, students can learn to make the most of their time and to grab every opportunity to succeed.
On hearing about this, Chow said happily, ""I really hope that my experiences can make young people understand that one should not be afraid of difficulties and setbacks  , for they are the only way to success.""
Indeed, Chow has travelled a long and difficult path to reach his success. In 1955, he was born into a poor family in Hong Kong. When he was 17, he had to leave school. He worked in a number of jobs--as a postman, camera salesman and taxi driver. These experiences paved   the way for him to play all kinds of roles later in life.
Chow broke into the film industry in the late 1970s. He was one of the hardest working actors and starred in a number of popular TV dramas and films including ""Shanghai Bund""(<<>> ) and ""A Better Tomorrow"". Since 1985, he has won many awards including Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards and Hong Kong Film Awards.
In 1995, he went to Hollywood. Although he was already over 40, he had to learn English. _ His film, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", began to gain him more fame and recognition around the world. In 1998, the mayor of Chicago set aside January 12 as ""Chow Yun-fat Day"".

My name is Amber and I want to share my story with you because what you've shared about life and positive energy has changed my life. This past year has been one of the hardest for me.

I read your blog every morning as I drink my coffee at work, but it wasn't until this March that I told myself ""no more negativity"" as you taught readers in your blog.

Instead of waiting for someone to ask me for help, I offer it with an open mind. The CEO noticed my change and offered me the executive assistant position that I wanted.
One of the biggest things I've taken to heart from your blog is changing my opinions on my job. Yes, it was not an important position, but when I was passionate   about it, I could make my life fulfilling.
All in all, I have to thank you somehow for having the passion to help others because it truly is inspiring to me. So thank you so much, John. My life has changed because your words pointed me in the right direction, Take care!

The son and daughter-in-law became unhappy with  _ . So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner at the dinner table. Since grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl.
Sometimes when the family glanced in grandfather's direction, he had a tear in his eyes as he ate alone. Still, the couple blamed him sharply when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year-old son watched it all in silence.
One evening, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps   on the floor. He asked the child, ""What are you making?"" The boy responded, ""Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and mama to eat your food from when I grow up."" The words so struck the parents that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done. That evening the husband took grandfather's hand and gently led him back to the family table.
For the rest of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled.

What grew from this soul searching was Ulifeline (www. Ulifeline. org), a Web site where students can get answers to questions about depression by logging on through their universities. The site has been adopted as a resource by over 120 colleges, which can customize it with local information, and over 1.3 million students have logged on with their college ID's.
""It is a very solid Web site that raises awareness of suicide, de-stigmatizes mental illness and encourages people to seek the help they need,""said Paul Grayson, the director of counseling services at New York University, which started using the service nearly a year ago.
The main component of the Web site is the Self-screening program developed by Duke University Medical Center that tests students to determine whether they are at risk for depression, suicide and disorders like anorexia and drug dependences. Besides helping students, the services compiles anonymous student date, offering administrators an important window onto the mental health of its campus.
The site provides university users with links to local mental health services, a catalog of information on prescription drugs and side effects, and access to Go Ask Alice, a vast archive developed by Columbia University with hundreds of responses to anonymously posted inquires from college students worldwide. For students concerned about their friends, there is a section that describes warning signs for suicidal behavior and depression.

""Having workers take responsibility for their own development might be dramatic, but it is now the rule,"" says the Educational and Training Support Agency.
""Today, not only are workers more mobile, they have to run to keep up with changes."" says the Government-founded agency.""It is no longer enough for a worker to gain a set of skills.Workers need the ability to react and get used to changes."" This new system is also being pushed along by the way that industry is looking to its workers to renew their own skills.In the United States, some companies have contracts   which repair their employees to show regularly how they have their skills up to date.

705,,"Passage: During the tsunami   disaster of 2004, over 300,000 people died. No one has counted the number of animals killed, but we know that it wasn't many. All over the region, before the disaster struck, animals were behaving strangely.
Shortly before the tsunami, in Khaolak, Thailand, twelve elephants that were giving tourists rides became agitated. They suddenly left their usual habitat, carrying four surprised Japanese tourists to safety. On the eastern coast of India, flamingos  , which should be breeding at this time of year, suddenly flew to higher ground. Of the two thousand wild pigs that live in an Indian nature reserve, only one was found dead after the tsunami.
The idea that the animals are able to predict disasters is nothing new. In fact, it has been well-recorded over the years. Twelve hours before Hurricane Charlie hit Florida in 2004, fourteen sharks left their natural habitat and stayed in deep waters for two weeks. The sharks, which were being observed by US scientists, had never done this before. They escaped the hurricane. In the winter of 1975 in Haicheng, China, snakes which would normally have been hibernating   were seen on the ground. Days later there was a big earthquake striking.
Unlike human beings, wild animals' senses are sharper and they can feel even the smallest changes in the environment. In other words, they see natural warnings that are invisible to the human eye. Ancient people probably had the similar ""senses"", which they needed to survive, but these have been lost to us as modern technology leads us further away from the danger that nature creates.
The real question is, can we use the reactions of animals to save ourselves from natural disasters? Animal behaviour expert, Rupesh Kaneira, believes we have no choice.

Explanation: 
When natural disasters strike, animals know what's going to happen. They don't just react to the disaster, but also help to protect themselves from it. Animals can predict disasters because they have an instinctive understanding of the environment. They know when something is about to change and react quickly to avoid danger.

Wild animals know when a tsunami is coming. Before the disaster struck, elephants in Thailand became agitated and carried tourists to safety. Wild pigs in India were found dead after the tsunami. Snakes in China were seen on the ground before the earthquake.

The flying car has been talked about for many years,but now it appears that the idea is about to become a reality.
An international company has built a two-seater plane that, at the touch of a button ,transforms into a car perfectly suitable for driving on public roads. It has been designed so that the wings fold up automatically; and it takes just 15 seconds to switch between flying and driving. With its wings fully open and the propeller spinning, it can take off from any airfield.
Flying cars are quicker than traditional ones for travelling from city to city,and they can run on ordinary fuel. Another big advantage is that they are cool ,like something you would see in an action film. At the moment9however, the flying car's wheels are illegal to leave the ground. That is not because of technical reasons or problems with the design. It is because the various road and aircraft authorities simply cannot agree on whether it is a car or a plane.
""The government and the authorities have never thought seriously about a flying car, says Alan Price ,the president of the company that has developed it. ""I wanted a car that could fly and drive ,but it is difficult to find an organization prepared to insure the vehicle against accidents.
Nevertheless?the company hopes to produce and deliver its first flying car soon. The company already has orders for 40 of them. The majority the potential customers are older and some are retired. There have even been orders from some people who have no pilot's license.
The flying car will cost around $ 200.000. ""For an airplane,that's a very reasonable price, but for a car, It's quite expensive,"" explains Alan. ""But it just is not possible to make a $ 10,000 flying car yet. ""
This latest means of transport will not become a mass-market item in the near future,but in the long term it has the potential to change the way you travel. It will become no more expensive than driving your car on the motorway. Travel time could be reduced by more than half.
So the next time you are told to fasten your seat belt, it may be to prepare for take-off.

Explanation: 
Flying cars are quicker than traditional ones for travelling from city to city, and they can run on ordinary fuel. Another big advantage is that they are cool, like something you would see in an action film. At the moment, however, the flying car's wheels are illegal to leave the ground. That is not because of technical reasons or problems with the design. It is because the various road and aircraft authorities simply cannot agree on whether it is a car or a plane. 

In the long term, flying cars will not become a mass-market item, but in the near future they have the potential to change the way you travel. It will become no more expensive than driving your car on the motorway. Travel time could be reduced by more than half. So the next time you are told to fasten your seat belt, it may be to prepare for take-off.

714,,"Passage: Microblogging is a broadcast medium in the form of blogging. A microblog differs from a traditional blog in that its content is typically much smaller, in both actual size and aggregate file size. Microblogs ""allow users to exchange small elements of content such as short sentences, individual images, or video links"".
As with traditional blogging, microbloggers post about topics ranging from the simple, such as ""what I'm doing right now,"" to the thematic , such as ""sports cars."" Commercial microblogs also exist, to promote   websites, services and/or products, and to promote collaboration within an organization.
Some microblogging services offer features such as privacy settings, which allow users to control who can read their microblogs, or other ways of publishing rights besides entering the web-based interface.  These may include text messaging, E-mail, or digital audio.
The first microblogs were known as tumblelogs. The term was invented in a blog post on April 12, 2005. However, by 2006 and 2007, the term microblog came into greater usage for such services provided by Tumbler and Twitter. Other leading social networking websites Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, and XING also have their own microblogging features, better known as status updates.
Several studies, especially by Harvard Business School have tried to analyze the usage behavior of Microblogging services. Many of these studies show that for services such as Twitter, there is a small group of active users contributing to most of the activity.
Twitter, Facebook and other microblogging services are also becoming a platform for marketing and public relations, with a sharp growth in the number of social media marketers. The Sysomos study shows that this specific group of marketers on Twitter is much more active than general user population, with 15% following more than 2,000 people.

Explanation: 
Microblogging protects privacy by not allowing readers to publish their views. In other words, it doesn't allow readers to enter their views. 
In fact, in microblogging, there is a concept of ""anonymous publishing"". The concept of anonymous publishing was introduced by Twitter. 
In anonymous publishing, the user who is publishing is not the person who is actually posting the microblog. The person who is actually posting the microblog is known as the ""user agent"".
The user agent is the person who is accessing the microblogging service.
The user agent is the person who is publishing the microblog. 
The user agent is not the person who is reading the microblog.

One afternoon in December 1982, when I was getting ready for Christmas, I suddenly decided to buy two dolls, one for my five-year-old daughter, Katie, and one for my old mother.
Things went smoothly when a friend told me that his dad, who played Santa Claus in my area, would be willing to make a visit on Christmas morning to our home with the gifts! Knowing that my parents would also come to my house, I began to get ready for the most memorable day of my mother's life.
Christmas Day arrived and so did Santa Claus at the planned time. Katie was very excited and happy all the time to welcome the Santa. My mother was enjoying watching Katie welcoming this special guest. As Santa turned to leave he looked again into his bag and took out one more gift. As he asked who Alice was, my mother, without thinking of her name being called, said that she in fact was Alice. Santa handed her the gift with a message card that read:

721,,"Passage: Mattel Inc. is _ 4.4 million Polly Pocket toys with magnets after some of them caused serious injuries to children who swallowed magnets that fell off.
Tiny magnets inside the toys may fall off without being noticed by parents and babysitters. The magnets can be swallowed or placed in children's noses or ears. When more than one magnet is swallowed, the magnets can attract each other and cause intestine perforation which can be deadly.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission(CPSC)received 170 reports of the small magnets coming out of these recalled toys. There were three reports of serious injuries to children who swallowed more than one magnet. All three suffered intestinal perforations that required operation. A 2-year-old child stayed in hospital for seven days and a 7-year-old child was hospitalized for 12 days. An 8-yeal-old child was also hospitalized.
The recalled Polly Pocket toys contain plastic dolls and accessories that have small magnets. The magnets measure one-eighth inch in diameter and are fixed in the hands and feet of some dolls, and even in the plastic clothing, hairpieces and other accessories to help the pieces stay on the doll or the doll's house.
The model number is printed on the bottom of the largest pieces on some of the toys. Contact Mattel if you cannot find a model number on your product to determine if it is part of the recall. Polly Pocket magnetic toys currently sold in stores are not included in this recall. The model numbers included in the recall are: B2632, B3158, B3201, B7118, G8605, H1537, H1538 and H3211. The toys were on sales in department stores and toy stores from May 2006 through September 2009 for between $15 and $30.
Consumers should immediately take these recalled toys away from children and contact Mattel for the return of the toys. For more information contact Mattel at 888 597-6597 anytime or visit the company's Web site.

The writer is suggesting that we should provide our names for our opinions, in order to demonstrate our responsibility for what we say. This is a good idea, since we cannot take responsibility for what we do not know about. The writer is also suggesting that we should not be anonymous, as this makes us less responsible for what we say. This is because we are not fully aware of what we are saying. We should provide our names and personal details, so that we can be held accountable for what we say.

Explanation: 

The most important advice for anyone who has been bitten by a snake is to stay calm and call an ambulance. The chances of survival from a snake bite are very good if the bite is treated quickly and correctly, so do not attempt to treat the bite yourself.

The only time that you should try to treat a snake bite yourself is if you are absolutely sure that you have been bitten by a poisonous snake, and you are in no immediate danger. If you are bitten by a poisonous snake, you should:

1. Wash the bite area with soap and water, and apply a cold compress to reduce the swelling.
2. Try to remove any clothing that is on the bite area, and apply a cold compress to the bite area for at least 10 minutes.
3. If you are bitten on the leg or foot, do not put anything on the bite area until the wound is cleaned and treated. If you do put something on the bite area, make sure it is a sterile dressing or bandage.
4. Call an ambulance immediately.
5. Do not try to move the bitten person or apply pressure to the bite area.

732,,"Passage: Vampires  , creatures of myth, have been around in one form or another for centuries. Terrifying but also attractive, they are as popular in the early 21st century as ever, as the current popularity of Twilight series, and its hero Edward Cullen, show. Vampires first appeared in fiction in the 1700s; in 1895 Irish novelist Bram Stoker published Dracula, introducing the world's most famous vampire.
But just what is it about these drinkers of human blood that continues to fascinate us? Speaking to Eric Lewis of the Times and Transcript website, academic Deborah Wells said that vampires are ""culturally adaptive "". ""We create very different vampires to fit different times. Edward Cullen is not the same as Count Dracula,"" she said.
Different as they are, Wells believes vampires are ""the perfect containers into which we can pour our current cultural anxieties"". Bram Stoker's Dracula is powerful, yet old and physically ugly. Stoker's book dealt with fear of the fall of the British Empire, real fears in the day in which it was written.
According to the website Bookpages, today's vampires have all our cultural desires, money, power and sexual attraction. Represented by Cullen, they are noble, handsome young men whom women find irresistible . What's more, vampires challenge traditional ideas about death, science and parental authority . This may be why teenagers are drawn to vampire tales.
""In many ways, the vampire story shows up teenage concerns,"" said Wells. ""The emotional intensity   of the relationship with the vampire matches the intensity of how it feels to have your first real love affairs. Your first real love, it really feels like life and death.""

Basically, A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. In an emergency, type O blood can be given because it is most likely to be accepted by all blood types, so it is often called the universal donor. However, there is still a risk.

Explanation: The question tells us that A and B cannot be mixed and that AB may receive A or B. These statements tell us that A and B cannot receive AB. However, this is not necessarily true. We can receive A or B from AB, and A or B from AB. So, in the end, we can receive A or B from AB. 

In fact, AB can receive A or B. The reason is that A and B are not the only blood types. In addition to AB, there are also O and AB. O is not related to A or B, so it cannot receive either. In addition, AB is not related to A or B, so it cannot receive AB. 

So, in fact, AB can receive A or B. However, A and B cannot receive AB. This is the most important part of the question.

741,,"Passage: ""Now I just don't believe that."" Surely all of us, at some point, have watched a movie and thought: It's simply badly researched, or, the makers must think we're fools.
If movies were completely scientifically accurate, they'd probably be as interesting as a Physics 101 lecture. In real life, there are no explosions in space, gas usually doesn't explode from a lit cigarette, and Bruce Willis / Jackie Chan / Will Smith would most likely be in a coma  after getting kicked in the head.
Recently, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph ran a humorous piece on unconvincing tech moments from some top movies. Let's see what _ are all about.
Telegraph writer Tom Chivers' first example is from the end-of-the-world movie Independence Day, in which a character comes up with a virus capable of destroying Windows, the computer system the alien  spacecraft uses. ""It's a good thing they didn't have Norton antivirus,"" jokes Chivers.
It's just one case of a movie that takes a lot of license with its science. Another one Chivers mentions is from Star Wars, where glowing beams of light traveling through space look very impressive. The problem is that in space there are no air particles  for the light to reflect off. In reality, they'd not be seen, which wouldn't look so cool on the big screen.
Chivers' second piece of Star Wars nonsense is the sound the fighters make in the movies: "" the bellow  of an elephant mixed with a car driving on a wet road"". But sound needs a medium to travel through, like air. In space, there wouldn't actually be any sound at all.
Few people would deny that the mind-bending Matrix films make for great viewing, but for Chivers, the science in the movies is a little silly.
And finally: as Chivers points out, DAN is not replaceable. But this bit of elementary genetics passed the makers of the 2002 Bond film Die another Day by. In the film the villain  has ""gene therapy"" to change his appearance and his DNA, which is completely impossible.

I drove my mother crazy ! But after a few years, my obsession stars faded as I matured and gained the confidence to socialize with ""real"" boys.
In the 35 years since I was a teenager, celebrity worship   has increased among teens due to the explosion of television celebrity gossip shows, and instant access to celebrity news on the Internet. It's no wonder that many teens are obsessed with stars when news programs are often filled with entertainment stories and the lives of celebrities.
Celebrity worship syndrome   is now considered a personality disorder. While it is normal for teenagers to follow the lives of their favorite stars, parents should try to monitor everything their child finds interesting. Parents should take action if they suspect a teen is too obsessed with celebrities and showing little interest in school or withdrawing from the family.  When teens talk a lot about celebrities and view them as just means of entertainment, this is considered normal celebrity worship. However, when a teenager is obsessed with a star and  often expresses a desire to have a close personal relationship with a celebrity or feels they have a special connection to a star, this may be the time for concern. Recent studies have shown that teens who develop an unhealthy obsession with celebrities often suffer from low self confidence and depression.

Viruses are very versatile and clever, and so there are things that they can do for us.Some scientists are using viruses as engineers to assemble solar panels, others are using viruses to manufacture proteins that could be used as drugs.So,maybe in the future we won't think of viruses as our enemies,but instead view them as our friends.

Historical evidence shows, for example, that people who lived over 3,000 years ago ate salted fish. Thousands of years ago in Egypt, salt was used to preserve   the dead.
Stealing salt was considered a major crime   during some periods of history. In the eighteenth century, for example, if a person was caught stealing salt, he could be put in prison and his ears could be cut off.
In the Roman Empire, one of the most important roads was the one that carried salt from the salt mines to Rome. Guards were stationed along the route to protect against salt thieves, and they received their pay in salt, thus bringing the English word, salary. Any guard who fell asleep while on duty was thought to be ""not worth his salt"", and as a result he would get a little less salt on his next payday. The expression, ""not worth his salt"", is still used today in English.
In the modern world salt has many uses beyond the dining table. It is used in making glass and airplane parts, in the growing of crops, and in the killing of weeds  . It is also used to make water soft, to melt   ice on roads and highways, to make soap, and to fix colors in cloth.
Salt can be got in various ways besides being taken from mines underground. Salt water from the ocean, salt water lakes or small seas can be used to make salt. Yet, no matter where it comes from, salt will continue to play an important role in the lives of people everywhere.

Li Honghai, the city official in charge of the battle, said,"" Linguistic perfection   is becoming increasingly important with the rise in the number of the foreigners flowing into the city.""
However, not everyone shares the disdain   of the Beijing government for the mixed language.""The choice of words is pretty much.One can either choose the verbs, adverbs, nouns or whatever one likes,"" explained one Hong Kong linguist on an Internet website.
So many examples exist that several Internet sites have been set up to collect Chinglish phrases.Many come from English instructions on packages such as a candle marked with ""Keep this candle out of children"" and a model boat--curiously named Posh Sailboat--which means, ""Please don't place it in dusty play.""

756,,"Passage: Among various programs, TV talk shows have covered every inch of space on daytime television. But no two shows are more opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest, than the Jerry Springer and Oprah Winfrey shows.
Jerry Springer could easily be considered the king of ""rubbish talk"". The show takes the ever-common talk show titles of love, sex, cheating, and hate, to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is about the dark side of society, yet people are willing to eat up the troubles of other people's lives.
Like Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes the TV talk show to its top. But Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show is mainly about the improvement of society and different quality of life. Contents are from teaching your children lessons, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.
Compared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being poured into society. Jerry ends every show with a ""final word"". He makes a small speech about the entire idea of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.
Clean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show's main audience are middle-class Americans. Most of the people have the time, money and ability to deal with life's tough problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of a connection with the young adults of society.

On Monday, February 13, Willard Mason sat down to talk about his relationship with the love he lost more than 60 years ago. Good fortune and fate recently helped the couple reunite.
In 1941, Willard Mason and Llah Ost, both senior 2 students, became engaged to be married and began planning their lives together. But Willard moved away to work at Willow Run Bomber Plant, where he met and fell in love with a woman named Helvi. He broke off his long distance engagement to Llah and married Helvi in 1942. Llah later found love with someone else. Both had happy marriages and raised families. 
Then, in 2003, Helvi died. A year later, Willard found himself back in his hometown, where by chance, he ran into Llah's brother. He informed Willard of the death of Llah's husband, and encouraged him to call her. 
After that first phone call, the couple began dating. Willard made the drive from his home near Houghton Lake to Llah's home in Adrian. On one such trip, he blacked out, and his car hit a tree.

They were spoken by Hamlet when he was thinking aloud, and they are the most famous words in Shakespeare because Hamlet was speaking not only for himself but also for every thinking man and woman. To be or not to be, to live or not to live, to live richly and abundantly, or to live dully and meanly. A philosopher once wanted to know whether he was alive or not, which is a good question for everyone to put to himself occasionally. He answered it by saying: ""I think, therefore I am.""
But the best definition of existence I ever saw was one written by another philosopher who said: ""To be is to be in relations."" If this is true, then the more relations a living thing has, the more it is alive. To live abundantly means simply to increase the range and intensity  of our relations. Unfortunately we are so constituted that we get to love our routine. But other than our regular occupation, how much are we alive? If you are interested only in your regular occupation, you are alive only to that extent. So far as other things are concerned --- poetry and prose , music, pictures, sports, unselfish friendships, politics, international affairs ---you are dead.
On the contrary, it is true that every time you acquire a new interest --- even more, a new accomplishment  --- you increase your power of life. No one who is deeply interested in different kinds of subjects can remain unhappy. The real _ is the person who has lost interest.
Bacon said that a man dies as often as he loses a friend. But we gain new life by contacts with new friends, and new ideas and thoughts, too. Where your thoughts are, there will be your life too. If your thoughts are limited only to your business, only to your physical welfare, only to your narrow circle of the town in which you live, then you live a narrow restricted(, ) life. But if you are interested in what is going on in China, then you are living in China. If you're interested in the characters of a good novel, then you are living with those highly interesting people. If you listen intently to fine music, you are away from your immediate surroundings and living in a world of passion and imagination.
To be or not to be --- to live intensely and richly, or merely to exist, which depends on ourselves. Let us widen and intensify our relations. While we live, let us live!

But if you are interested in what is going on in China, then you are living in China. If you're interested in the characters of a good novel, then you are living with those highly interesting people. If you listen intently to fine music, you are away from your immediate surroundings and living in a world of passion and imagination.
To be or not to be --- to live intensely and richly, or merely to exist, which depends on ourselves. Let us widen and intensify our relations. While we live, let us live!

Question: What is the main idea of the passage? 

Options:
A) To be is to be in relations.
B) I think, therefore I am.
C) To be or not to be, that is a question.
D) A man dies as often as he loses a friend.

Tobacco plants produce nicotine because it defends against insects that would otherwise eat the plants.
              The butts are undoubtedly smelly. But birds are actually quite fond of smelly chemicals, such as those found in aromatic   plants.

              In the study, researchers at the Autonomous University of Tlaxcala in Mexico set up heat traps, which attract harmful insects, in 55 nests around Mexico City.

Whether the nest held eggs, chicks or nothing, the unsmoked cigarette traps collected more harmful insects, suggesting that it is the chemicals that drove harmful insects away.
              In a second experiment, the researchers collected 28 house sparrow nests and 29 house finch   nests from Mexico City immediately after the chicks flew out for food. They found that the more smoked filter stuff filled a nest, the fewer harmful insects it had.

Some researchers consider that attitudes come from differences between beliefs and ideas; others believe that attitudes come from emotional states. Here, we focus on the effects of attitudes upon behavior, that is, upon the choices of action made by the individual.
The kinds of actions taken by human beings are obviously influenced greatly by attitudes. Whether one listens to classical music or rock, whether one obeys the speed limit while driving, whether one encourages one's husband or wife to express his or her own ideas-all are influenced by attitudes. These internal states are acquired  throughout life from situations one is faced with in the home, in the streets, and in the school.
Of course, the course of action chosen by an individual in any situation will be largely determined by the particulars of that situation. An individual who has a strong attitude of obeying laws may drive too fast when he is in a hurry and no police cars in sight. A child who has a strong attitude of honesty may steal a penny when she thinks no one will notice. But the internal state which remains unchanged over a period of time, and which makes the individual behave regularly in a variety of situations, is what is meant by an attitude.
Attitudes are learned in a variety of ways. They can result from single events, as when an attitude toward snakes is acquired by an experience in childhood at the sudden movement of a snake. They can result from the individual's experiences of success and pleasure, as when someone acquires a positive attitude toward doing crossword puzzles by being able to complete some of them. And frequently, they are learned by copying other people's behavior, as when a child learns how to behave toward foreigners by observing the actions of his parents. Regardless of these differences, there is something in common in the learning and modification  of attitudes.

Attitudes learned in danger will last no more. Attitudes are learned by one's experiences. It is not possible to acquire an attitude without experiencing success. When one experiences a failure, the attitude is lost. Attitudes learned in danger will last no more.
Copying others' behavior is not a good idea. Attitudes are learned from one's experiences. The individual is able to acquire a favorable attitude only if he has experienced success. If one does not experience success, then the attitude will not last long.

I had never expected to visit Paris. The French culture didn' t interest me that much, and Paris seemed too big, too touristy, too much. But when I found myself standing next to the Opera National de Paris, completely alone and totally lost, I knew I was in for an interesting ride. I had decided to take a summer history class abroad, and Paris just happened to be where it was set. My teacher eventually found me and other jet-lagged students and walked us down to where we would be staying. Even then, tired, hungry, and feeling displaced, I was unable to keep myself from marveling at the beauty of the city.
The next day in the grocery store, trying to decide if the box I was holding contained butter or cream cheese, I suddenly realized I was a foreigner that didn't speak the language.The cashier and I had a conversation completely with gestures. For the most part, it didn't seem to bother the French that I was utterly incompetent in speaking their language. In fact, from my first unclear ""bonjour"" , many of them would directly switch over to English.
Time Hew by. In the mornings we had class, and in the afternoons we were given a lot of freedom to do what we pleased. We explored everywhere in the city, becoming experts at using the Metro, and walking so much that our legs were sore every night.
Living in Paris was a huge change in my lifestyle. Everything I did was more relaxed. I stopped worrying about the future and instead focused on living in the present. I stopped wearing a watch because time didn't matter.We ate when we were hungry, went to bed when we were tired and explored in between.I no longer mind that Paris is so big; it' s an old, beautiful metropolis full of culture and history.On one of my last days there, standing on top of the Arc du Triumph with a 360 degree view of Paris, I finally admitted something to myself.The city that I had never wanted to visit had turned into the city that I never wanted to leave.

This discovery led to the establishment of Banff National Park, and marked the beginning of Canada's national park system. Spanning 6,641 meadows and rivers, Banff National Park is one of the world's premier destination spots.

The author also says that Dorothy's 'bloom' is not visible from the train. This means that she is not visible from the train. So, the answer is 'D'.",C,A,False
793,,"Passage: In my living room, there is a plaque   that advises me to ""Bloom   where you are planted."" It reminds me of Dorothy. I got to know Dorothy in the early 1980s, when I was teaching Early Childhood Development through a program with Union College in Barbourville, Kentucky. The job responsibilities requested occasional visits to the classroom of each teacher in the program. Dorothy stands out in my memory as one who ""bloomed"" in her remote area.
              Dorothy taught in a school In Harlan County, Kentucky, Appalachian Mountain area. To get to her school from the town of Harlan, I followed a road winding around the mountain. In the eight-mile journey, I crossed the same railroad track five times, giving the possibility of getting caught by the same train five times. Rather than feeling excited by this drive through the mountains, I found it depressing. The poverty level was shocking and the small shabby  houses gave me the greatest feeling of hopelessness.
              From the moment of my arrival at the little school, all gloom   disappeared. Upon arriving at Dorothy's classroom. I was greeted with smiling faces and treated like a queen. The children had been prepared to show me their latest projects. Dorothy told me with a big smile that they were serving poke greens salad and cornbread for ""dinner"" (lunch). In case you don't know, poke greens are a weed-type plant that grows wild, especially on poor ground.
              Dorothy never ran out of reports of exciting activities of her students. Her enthusiasm  never cooled down. When it came time to sit for the testing and interviewing required to receive her Child Development Associate Certification, Dorothy was ready. She came to the assessment and passed in all areas. Afterward, she invited me to the one-and-only steak house in the area to celebrate her victory, as if she had received her Ph. D. degree. After the meal, she placed a little box containing  an old pen in my hand. She said it was a family heirloom  , but to me it is a treasured symbol of appreciation and pride that cannot be matched with things.  (360 words)

802,,"Passage: Studies show that you may be lied to every day anywhere from 10 to 200 times. We say, ""Nice song."" ""Honey, you don't look fat in that, no."" But another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're married, you're going to lie to your wife/ husband in one out of every 10 communications. If you're unmarried, that number drops to three. But look, if at some point you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth about lying: lying's a cooperative act. Not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing to lie for the sake of social dignity  , maybe to keep a private secret.
Lying is complex. It's woven into the fabric of our daily and business lives. We're deeply disturbed by the truth. We explain it, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps between ideals and realities in our lives.

807,,"Passage: Many people turn to doctors or self-help books, but they forget a great thing that could help them fight illness: their friends.
Researchers are only now starting to pay attention to the importance of friendship in health. A 10-year Australian study found that older people with a large circle of friends were 22 percent less likely to die during the study period than those with fewer friends. A large 2007 study showed an increase of nearly 60 percent in the danger for _ among people whose friends gained weight. And last year, Harvard researchers reported that strong social ties  could improve brain health as we age.
""In general, the role of friendship in our lives isn't well realized,"" said Rebecca, a professor at the University of North Carolina. ""Friendship has a bigger effect on our psychological   health than family relationships.""
While many friendship studies are about the close relationships of women, some research shows that it can do good to men too. In a six-year study of 736 middle-aged men, having friendships reduces the risk of heart attack. Only smoking was as important a danger factor   as having little social support.
The exact reason why friendship has such a big effect isn't clear. While friends can send a sick person to the hospital or pick up medicine, the advantages go well beyond physical help. Friendship clearly has a big psychological effect. ""People with stronger friendships feel like there is someone they can turn to,"" said Karen, a doctor. ""The message of these studies is that friends make your life better.""

Played in an indoor court, cycle ball is similar to soccer in many ways--the aim is to score as many goals as possible, and only the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball.
The one big difference? Use of legs is forbidden. Instead, players have to guide the ball across the court, using the front wheels of their bicycles or with their heads.

812,,"Passage: Have you heard of the scandal that happened in one of Great Britain's biggest supermarket chains called Tesco? The British love Tesco as it sells very cheap products and it can be found on almost every corner of a British city or town.
On January 15th 2013 food inspectors discovered 30 % horsemeat in a certain brand of frozen beefburgers that were mostly sold by Tesco in the UK and Ireland.
In times of social media like Facebook and Twitter the news has spread fast and customers have been very concerned about what the food they buy actually contains. Tesco said it had taken away the burgers from the shop shelves immediately, and apologized to their customers. They also promised that they would find out what exactly happened and that they would work harder than ever so this would never happen again. Customers are also able to return the beefburgers and get a refund, that is, their money back.
However, it will be hard for Tesco to get the people's trust back. Just imagine buying lovely beefburgers that you fry at home and suddenly you find out that you have actually eaten horsemeat! In this case not only horse lovers will be upset!
By the way, why are British people so shocked about eating horsemeat? In history, horses have played great roles as working animals and as an important means of transport. When Britons of today think of horses, they think of majestic animals or cute pets rather than meat.
But this is not the only reason for the protest: Customers also want to be sure that the products they buy contain what it says on the label. Hopefully, supermarkets can avoid mistakes like that in the future. Maybe there should be stricter regulations and more controls of our food? Otherwise we will soon find ourselves eating panda meat instead of pork and parrot instead of chicken. So the next time you are in a supermarket maybe check the ingredients of your food before you buy it or you could get a nasty surprise ...

If you have the right kind of job or go to the right social gatherings, then you receive the insincere approval of others. This means that your self-esteem  is always at the mercy of others, with no appreciation of you as an individual.
A life, on the other hand, is very different. A life is what you lead when you know what matters most to you. It is very simple and comes from being connected to what you know is important and being willing to put that first, no matter what others may think. When you create a life vs. a lifestyle, your self-esteem comes from what's inside you, not what others think about you.
Lifestyle is expensive financially and personally, because it costs a great deal to keep up appearances and do what you think is socially acceptable. A life is not expensive. Rather than using personal or financial resources, a life generates energy and staying power. It's about liberating yourself from the mindless consumption that society expects. It is about making the choices that are in line with your values, instead of using up your bank account or energy for no heart-driven reason.

818,,"Passage: Long after the 1998 World Cup was won, disappointed fans were still cursing the disputed refereeing decisions that denied victory to their team. A researcher was appointed to study the performance of some top referees.
The researcher organized an experimental tournament involving four youth teams. Each match lasted an hour, divided into three periods of 20 minutes during which different referees were in charge.
Observers noted down the referees' errors, of which there were 61 over the tournament. Converted to a standard match of 90 minutes, each referee made almost 23 mistakes, a remarkably high number.
The researcher then studied the videotapes to analyse the matches in detail. Surprisingly, he found that errors were more likely when the referees were close to the incident. When the officials got it right, they were, on average, 17 meters away from the action. The average distance in the case of errors was 12 meters. The research shows the optimum   distance is about 20 meters.
There also seemed to be an optimum speed. Correct decisions came when the referees were moving at a speed of about 2 meters per second. The average speed for errors was 4 meters per second.
If FIFA, football's international ruling body, wants to improve the standard of refereeing at the next World Cup, it should encourage referees to keep their eyes on the action from a distance, rather than rushing to keep up with the ball, the researcher argues.
He also says that FIFA's insistence that referees should retire at age 45 may be misguided. If keeping up with the action is not so important, their physical condition is less critical.

To think that something that did not even exist 50 years ago has come to _ our lives like this in just about 15 years makes one wonder - just what will the future bring?
In 2004, a survey was conducted in the US asking a group of technology experts their opinions on the Internet in the next ten years. 57% of them agreed that virtual classes will be more widely adopted in schools, allowing students to learn with those at the same level and with interests in the same subjects. It's quite possible that, by the year 2030, every child in every school will do all their schoolwork on their own laptop with all their textbooks available on the Internet. No more heavy books to carry around and no more pens and paper!
At work, we already use email to deal with people both inside and outside our offices and video conferencing  is occurring more frequently. This means that meetings can be held between offices in different countries without the trouble caused by business travel. Business travel will not exist in the future, and so will offices as people all start to work from home.
It has also become a trend for people to use pocket computers such as Blackberries. With this helpful equipment, people can send and receive emails, surf the Web, and read multimedia files from absolutely anywhere even if we are on a beach holiday.
The Internet will have a revolutionary effect on entertainment in the future.

Explanation:  The verb 'play' can be used in two ways:
1) To indicate a role in which a person plays a part, e.g. ""The president plays a crucial role in the decision-making process.""
2) To indicate the effect of something, e.g. ""The Internet has changed the way we play video games.""
In this question, we are told that ""The Internet has changed the way we play video games."" We have to choose the correct answer which indicates the effect of something.
Now, we know that the verb 'play' can be used in two ways. So, we can choose any of these two ways in this question. But we need to choose one of these two ways as the correct answer. We have to choose 'play' in the second way because 'play' is used in the second way.

829,,"Passage: Among the many differences between Western and Chinese cultures, table manners are one of the most noticeable  differences. Westerners often make mistakes at the table in China or in a Chinese home. In order not to have an embarrassing  experience, here are some things to consider next time you are eating with some Chinese.
Step1:
Keep in mind that food is shared. It is one of the biggest differences between Chinese and Western eating habits. In China a few dishes are placed in the center of a table and shared by all. Also, you should offer thanks when a Chinese host takes food from one of the dishes on the table and places it on your plate. Refusing it would not be polite even if you are full.
Step2:
Respect the chopsticks. The chopsticks are the single most important tool at a Chinese table. Use the chopsticks to grab food and never skewer   it. Also make sure to place your chopsticks over your bowl or plate. Don't lay them on the table or even worse, stick them into the rice bowl.
Step3:
Use communal chopsticks. To take food from the center of the table you should use the communal chopsticks or spoons that are placed there for that purpose. If there are no communal tools, use the other ends of your chopsticks to take food, remembering not to use the other end to put food into your mouth.
Step4:
Respect the elders. Table manners in China place extra respect on elders. At the table, pass food to your elders before taking it for yourself. If someone makes a toast, make sure that when you clink glasses with someone older than you, the rim of your glass is lower than the rim of the elder person.

Question: How can you use your chopsticks according to the passage?

A) Use them to grab your own food.
B) Put them on the table.

*Before you apply
1. Work hard to get good grades. Don't sweat about one bad grade, but always strive to do your best.
2. Get involved, and stay involved, in extracurricular activities. Sports, clubs, drama, bands and orchestras-these often count toward a student's overall scholarship application evaluation. The same goes for paid (or unpaid) work experience.
3. Begin your scholarship research early-by your sophomore or junior year of high school, if possible. Make special note of application deadlines, as they can vary from late summer to late spring.
4. Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for-several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money.
*During the application process
1. Read the supplementary materials that come with scholarship application forms to better understand the program's focus (community service, subject interest). Try to answer the questions with the focus area in mind.
2. Answer questions as they are asked. Don't go off the topic.
3. If there is a financial component to the application, make sure you get accurate and complete information from all appropriate sources to ensure your eligibility.
4. Take your time. Write down everything you can think of for each question, then set the application aside for a day so you can look everything over again before you send it off.
5. Don't wait until the last minute to complete your application, especially if you are applying online. Computer systems can get clogged with the large volume of applicants hoping to submit their qualifications during the last few days and hours before a deadline.
6. If a third party has to complete part of your application, such as providing a letter of recommendation, make sure you ask them early on and remind them as often as necessary to ensure they provide you with the necessary materials.

Many artists late in the last century were in search of a means to express their individuality. Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. At the beginning there was no exacting technique, no foundation from which to build. In later years, trial, error and genius founded the techniques and the principles of the movement. Eventually, innovators   even drew from what they considered the dread ballet, but first they had to get rid of all that was academic so that the new could be discovered. The beginnings of modern dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed  .
Her search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea, and should be in harmony with the movements of the Earth. Her great contributions are in three areas.
First, she began the expansion of the kinds of movement that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concert. In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity   shown by complex, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using her body in the freest possible way. Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.
Her second contribution lies in dance costume. She rejected ballet shoes and stiff costumes. These were replaced with flowing Grecian   tunes, bare feet, and unbound hair. She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.
Her third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies of great masters including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom.

At the top of the South Pole,any clock or watch keeps good time because all meridians  join there.All kinds of local time are completely suitable there.It is even difficult to distinguish  New Year's Eve from New Year's Day.

Petroleum
We are using up the world's petroleum.We use it in our cars and to heat our buildings in winter.Farmers use petrochemicals to make the soil rich.They use them to kill insects on those plants.These chemicals go into rivers and lakes and kill the fish there.Thousands of people also die from these chemicals every year.Chemicals also go into the air and pollute it.Winds carry this polluted air to other countries and other countries.

Distribution means that the things are in the right place at the right time.

However, this is not a problem for one country or one area of the world.

It is a problem for all humans.

On this particular afternoon, the odds were all on Nathan's side. First, he was stronger. Tim had always been thin, but recently he'd started to grow so fast that his arms and legs were like pieces of spaghetti. As well as being considerably fitter than his friend, Nathan knew the shortcuts up prefix = st1 /BlackMountain. 
So when Nathan accepted the challenge, he was sure he'd win. He nearly always did, in competitions with Tim. That was what was strange. Tim was so competitive, and yet he wasn't any good at physical things. 
By the time the two boys were three quarters of the way to the top, Nathan was clearly ahead. While the road zigzagged back and forth up the mountainside, in certain places, there were also vertical tracks, where water rushing down the slope in winter had bitten erosion courses into the soil. These had in turn been so overgrown by bushes and long grass in the spring that they looked like tunnels through the bush. The trick was to know where you could cut off a whole bend in the road by leaving the road and pushing your bike up one of these half-hidden pathways. If you chose the wrong one you'd struggle up for ten minutes and then suddenly reach a dead end. Then there was no choice but to go back.

867,,"Passage: Most people who live in Seattle, Washington, love their city. There is a never-ending flow of fun things to do. But, people who live there do not always enjoy the day-after-day absence of sunshine during the winter months.
It is documented fact that sunshine (or lack of it) plays a major role in how each of us meets the day. It also affects how we perform at school or work. When people are derived of sunlight, they can develop seasonal affective disorder, which makes it difficult for them to feel happy or get things accomplished. No major city in the United States is more affected by the ""sunshine factor"" than Seattle.
To fight drizzle and fog during the winter months, Steve Murphy created a business that is very popular among the locals. The Indoor Sun Shoppe is more than a little ray of sunshine during the gray days of Seattle's winter. His shop offers a huge source of plants and artificial lighting for people who are trying to overcome seasonal affective disorder.
Located in Fremont, Washington, The Indoor Sun Shoppe has an amazing collection of exotic plants and ""good bugs"" in a humid and well-lit environment. At The Indoor Sun Shoppe, you can spend up to $400 for artificial lighting that will chase away the winter blues. It will also keep your plants healthy. You can buy a dawn simulator that will gradually fill your room with a warming wake-up glow. What better way to meet a Seattle morning when real sunshine is nothing more than a happy thought!
Murphy's in-home waterfalls are also popular with customers. But his plants and lights remain the ""main course."" On a cloudy winter day, The Indoor Sun Shoppe is a bright spot in Seattle!

Question: Which of the following best explains the use of a dawn simulator? 

Options:
A) An alarm clock stimulated by the light rays of early morning.
B) A bringer of indoor artificial sunshine when there is none outside.
C) An automatic waterfall system helping make indoor plants healthy.
D) A better way to meet a Seattle morning with real warming sunshine.

the easy carelessness of  youth. But the words, Carl Walter spoke that day, came back to me
years later, and ever since have been of great value to me.
Carl Walter was my piano teacher. During one of my lessons he asked how much practicing I
was doing. I said three or four hours a day.
""Do you practice
, an hour at a time?""
""I try to.""
""Well, don't,"" he exclaimed. ""When you grow up, time won't come in long stretches.    Practice in minutes, whenever you can find them five or ten before school, after lunch, between household tasks. Spread the practice through the day, and piano-playing will become a part of your life.""
When I was teaching at Columbia, I wanted to write, but class periods, theme-reading, and committee meetings filled my days and evenings. For two years I got practically nothing down on paper, and my excuse was that I had no time. Then I remembered what Carl Walter had said. During the next week I conducted an experiment. Whenever I had five minutes unoccupied, I sat down and wrote a hundred words or so. To my astonishment, at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript ready for revision, later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal method. Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever, in every day there were idle moments which could be caught and put to use. I even took up piano--playing again, finding that the small intervals of the day provided sufficient time for both writing and piano practice.
There is an important trick in this time--using formula: you must get into your work quickly. If you have but five minutes for writing, you can't afford to waste four chewing your pencil. You must make your mental preparations beforehand, and concentrate on your task almost instantly when the time comes. Fortunately, rapid concentration is easier than most of us realize.
I admit I have never learnt how to let go easily at the end of the five or ten minutes. But life can be counted on to supply interruptions. Carl Walter has had a tremendous influence on my life. To him I owe the discovery that even very short periods of time add up to all useful hours I need, if I plunge in without delay.

Question: Which of the following statements is true? 

Options:
A) The writer didn't completely take the teacher's words to heart at first.
B) Carl Walter has had a great influence on the writer's life since he became a student.

In the 1986 movie Nothing in Common, Jackie Gleason's character, Max Basner, gets fired (or unemployed) from his job as a clothing salesman. The scene, shot   on a boat, shows Max's despair  about being out of work. I was looking for some gesture that would allow Max to show his feelings.
Jackie had far more experience  at everything than I did, and at first I was frightened (very much afraid). What could I possibly tell ""The Great One"" about acting? Out of fear I decided to direct by suggestion, and I sat down with Gleason to talk about the scene. ""So Max is sad, right?"" I said.
Gleason nodded.
""And he's probably still carrying his pens with his name on them --- the ones he used to hand out to his customers, right?""
Gleason nodded.

Explanation: 
In the 1986 movie Nothing in Common, Jackie Gleason's character, Max Basner, gets fired (or unemployed) from his job as a clothing salesman. The scene, shot   on a boat, shows Max's despair  about being out of work. I was looking for some gesture that would allow Max to show his feelings.

World's Largest Ball of Paint
Alexandria, Ind. 
In 1977, Michael Carmichael set out to create the biggest ball of paint anywhere. Starting with a baseball as centre, he painted layer by layer of paint day after day, year after year. The ball weighs more than 1,300 pounds, with more than 20,000 coats of paint, which is recognized by Guinness World Record. Visitors can paint the wall themselves and become part of the history.
The Museum of Dirt
Boston, Mass. 
The museum is the idea of Glenn Johnson. Labeled   glass bottles contain such treasures as dirt from the Great Wall of China, as well as sand from a desert in Saudi Arabia and Omaha Beach in France. Best of all, the cost of seeing this museum is dirt cheap: It's free.
Mount Horeb Mustard Museum 
Mount Horeb, Wis. 
It's heaven for hotdog lovers! This museum says it has to have the world's largest collection for prepared mustard . Its more than 4,100 bottles of spices  come from 60 nations, including Turkey and China. Visitors learn the history of mustard, from how it's made to how it's advertised and sold. The museum's creator, Barry Levenson, loves mustard so much that he even puts it on ice-cream!
Paper House
Rockport, Mass. 
Swedish immigrant  Ellis Stenman was much ahead of his time in 1922, when he started to build a two-room house almost entirely out of newspaper. At the time, people didn't give much---if any---thought to recycling paper. In fact, ""recycling"" wasn't even a word yet.

C) Water
D) Ink

Option A, B, and D are not correct.

Explanation: 

Baking soda is used as an ingredient in many recipes. It is also used as an ingredient in invisible ink.

Invisible ink is a type of ink that is used to write a secret message without leaving any visible traces.

The secret message is usually written onto a piece of paper using invisible ink.

The paper is then placed in a light source, such as a light bulb, which causes the ink to react with the baking soda, resulting in the message becoming visible.

The secret message can then be read using a magnifying glass or a light source.

Note: This method of making invisible ink is not very accurate and may not always work. It is not recommended for serious use.

Explanation: 

Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, a white powder that is used in baking. It is also used in other applications, such as making invisible ink. The reaction between baking soda and water produces carbon dioxide gas, which is what gives the ink its white color.

The reaction between baking soda and water also produces a solution of sodium bicarbonate and water. This solution can be used to make invisible ink. The sodium bicarbonate in the solution reacts with the water to produce carbon dioxide gas, which causes the ink to change color.

Invisible ink is a type of message that is hidden in plain sight. It can be read using a special reader that uses ultraviolet light to reveal the hidden message. Invisible ink is often used for secret messages, as it is difficult to read without the special reader.

A week ago, I wouldn't have been sitting here with him during breakfast. I wouldn't have been up, emptying the dishwasher, cleaning the kitchen, or answering emails.

Then we went to visit friends for a weekend. They have two kids. They are busy, professional, and good parents. And at every meal -- not just dinner -- we all sat down at the table and ate. When we got home, my husband said, ""Maybe we should be doing that.""

He was a very wealthy man who had made a lot of money through his circus shows. Barnum wanted to give small children a chance to see a big show. He thought that if they saw how big and strong and brave people were, they might be inspired to do something great themselves. Barnum said that he wanted to bring in little people who were just the same as big people. He said that they would be able to do everything that big people could do.

The word ""accent"" refers to the way that people speak, which can be influenced by the way they were raised. The word ""accent"" can also refer to the way that people speak in a particular language, which can be influenced by the way that they were raised. For example, someone who grew up in a rural area may have a different accent than someone who grew up in a city. This can make it difficult for people from different backgrounds to communicate with each other.

However, with a few saving tricks and a little research, there are still lots of great deals to be had on airline tickets and more.
Early Bird Gets the Deal.
Travel experts say that there are certain times of day when more deals are available. Airfares can change three times a day as airlines adjust their prices to fill up flights. Early morning is when the fares tend to be lowest.www.zxxk.com
What Wouldn't a Business Traveler do?
Flying when business travelers don't can save you big money. Most business travelers fly on Mondays and Fridays, so Tuesday and Wednesday are the best days. Airlines will usually lower their prices on these days to aggressively try and fill empty seats.
 _ 
 _ 
Fly to popular places at unpopular times. The slowest time of the year for travel is in the Fall between Labor Day and Thanksgiving. Again, to try and fill more empty seats, the airlines will lower prices and offer better deals to get people to fly during this time of the year.
Package Deals
Many times the best deals on airfare can be found as part of a package rate. Most travel sites have package rates available. Often, the entire package (hotel, airfare, rental car) is cheaper than just the plane ticket on another site. Even if you don't need the rental car, with the money you've saved on the flight, you can afford to take a taxi. These deals are especially good on last minute bookings.
With a little inside knowledge and some good timing, you can get yourself a steal on a ticket to the vacation you thought was out of reach.

909,,"Passage: Travel can be a lifesaver. But in today's economy   with airlines adding new fees almost daily and ticket prices sharply on the rise, many have written off travel as too expensive. However, with a few saving tricks and a little research, there are still lots of great deals to be had on airline tickets and more.
Early Bird Gets the Deal.
Travel experts say that there are certain times of day when more deals are available. Airfares can change three times a day as airlines adjust their prices to fill up flights. Early morning is when the fares tend to be lowest.www.zxxk.com

Fly to popular places at unpopular times. The slowest time of the year for travel is in the Fall between Labor Day and Thanksgiving. Again, to try and fill more empty seats, the airlines will lower prices and offer better deals to get people to fly during this time of the year.
Package Deals
Many times the best deals on airfare can be found as part of a package rate. Most travel sites have package rates available. Often, the entire package (hotel, airfare, rental car) is cheaper than just the plane ticket on another site. Even if you don't need the rental car, with the money you've saved on the flight, you can afford to take a taxi. These deals are especially good on last minute bookings.
With a little inside knowledge and some good timing, you can get yourself a steal on a ticket to the vacation you thought was out of reach.

Many police officials blame professional thieves for the large number of the thefts. It is a major moneymaker for organized crime.

One exception is a Michigan program that calls for 92 police officers to work full time on the state's 65,000 car theft cases a year. Since 2006, when the effort began, the state's auto theft rate has fallen from second in the nation to ninth.
How can you protect your car? If you live in a high theft area or drive an expensive model, consider a safety system. It may cost anywhere from $ 25 to $ 1,000. Some systems work automatically - simply removing the key disables the fuel pump and the starter. When cars are equipped with such systems, thefts may drop by one third. In some states, you may be able to use a device that transmits radio signals, allowing stolen cars to be tracked by police.

Question: What type (s) of safety system can help the police find a stolen car back? 

Options:
A) The device that sends out radio signals.
B) The device that disables the fuel pumps.
C) The device that disables the starter.
D) All of the above.

This is also why they put the most expensive items in the first section. They want the customer to see the price tag first and then go on to buy other items.

We all want to make our fathers proud. So it is natural to think of how much time has passed since he was born. Time flies, but it doesn't go back in time. It is a concept that is difficult to understand for children. A gift can make him think about how time flies, but it is not the best way to do it.

You can make your father think about how time flies by making him remember your childhood. 

For example, you can make a box and put in some of your childhood items, such as a photo album, a diary, or a journal. Then, you can write a letter to your father, saying, ""I hope you will remember these things as you grow up.""

928,,"Passage: London Heathrow is the biggest airport in the UK, and it also handles more international passenger traffic than any other airport in the world. For this reason, enlargement was planned and on 27th March a fifth terminal opened to help to deal with the many passengers that pass through the airport. The new terminal has taken a long time to plan and build. The idea was first proposed back in the 1980s. The opening of it has been talked about widely in the media in the UK and expectations were high for the PS4.3 billion project.
   However, in spite of long preparations at Terminal 5 ahead of the grand opening, things soon went into a mess. There were problems from the very beginning as staff had difficulties finding car parking spaces and getting through security to get into the building. This consequently caused a delay when passengers started to arrive and large numbers of staff were not in place. Long passenger queues formed and the slow start meant that everyone had to play catch-up from the beginning. Staffs were having problems using the new systems and a baggage operator told the BBC, it was all ""shambles   the moment the doors opened"". The terminal has been designed to handle 12,000 bags an hour but due to a reported ""lack of training and essential support that was promised"", a backlog   of luggage soon appeared.
   By lunchtime on that first day, 20 flights had been cancelled to try to alleviate the problems. Flights continued to be cancelled in the days following the opening and up to 28,000 bags have now had to be placed in temporary storage. The British Airline, the only airline operating at Terminal 5 says it is working to clear the backlog, but the negative publicity caused by the shambles has not helped the airport or the airline's reputation at all.

Question: What was the difficulty that passengers met with on the very first day of the opening? 

Options:
A) It was difficult for them to find the right car parking spaces.
B) It took too long to get through security to get into the building.
C) They were not familiar with the new systems in the building.
D) They had to wait a long time and play catch-up when checking in.

That signals continued bad news for retailers , who have been struggling to respond to a great cutback in spending as consumers have opened their wallets only for basic items, while cutting back on unimportant purchases.
The report, which estimates retail sales growth to be flat this year, found that three-quarters of respondents to a monthly survey of 4,000 consumers said they had shifted their shopping behaviors because of the economy. Most said they were making do with less or going without some favorite items.
""The habits learned during this economic crisis have the potential to permanently change the mind-set of consumers,"" the report said. ""The vast majority of shoppers who are changing their near-term shopping behavior say they plan to continue them as the economy improves.""

He'd been running a heavy load of tractors and forklifts from Georgia to Indianapolis when a van in front of him stopped suddenly in traffic on the icy road. As Ronnie bore down, he could see children in the backseat. The truck's bulk would probably protect him from the worst of the impact, but the force of 23 tons would likely crush everyone inside the van.
""I figured instead of killing other people, I'd just put the truck in the ditch."" At the bottom, rocks cut a fuel tank, which caught fire. A tree branch destroyed the windshield and knocked Ronnie unconscious. He came to life a couple of minutes later to find the cabin flames and his legs on fire.
Steve dashed to Ronnie, who was hanging headfirst from the passenger door. Ronnie had used his pocket knife to cut himself free from the driver's side seat belt only to get his boot trapped in another one. Steve climbed into the burning cab to free him.
He tried three times to pull Ronnie out before finally freeing him. But Ronnie's legs were still burning, so Steve laid him on the ground, ripped off his own shirt, and beat the flames with it. He'd managed to drag him about 20 yards when one of the truck's 150 gallon fuel tanks exploded.
Both Steve and Ronnie paid a price for risking their lives for strangers. Ronnie spent two months in the hospital and received skin grafts  on both of his legs. Steve suffered smoke breathing and minor burns, and shrapnel from the fuel tank explosion broke a tooth.
In February, the Coopers received a Hero of the Highway award from the Open Road Foundation for rescuing an injured driver. Steve insists Ronnie is the real hero: ""If he hadn't gone into the ditch, he would have hit that van. It was his decision to drive off the road.""
""I feel pretty good about it,"" says Ronnie. ""A lot of people could have been hurt.""

Explanation: 

    The reason why some entrepreneurs don't invite clients to their home is because they would rather enjoy convenience outside their home. It may also be because they don't want to let others know their business, for fear that their customers will be suspicious or even angry when they come to their home and find it empty. They may also want to avoid being seen by burglars. However, in order to avoid being seen by burglars, it's important to have a good security system in place.

Explanation:  Home-based entrepreneurs may invite clients to their homes as a matter of convenience. The client may even be grateful for the extra space and privacy. But, there are also good reasons why home-based entrepreneurs may not invite clients to their homes. 

A)  The main reason for home-based entrepreneurs not inviting clients to their homes is to avoid burglars and other criminals. They may fear that their neighbors might suspect that they are running a business from their home. They may also fear that their neighbors might become suspicious and report them to the police.

B)  Home-based entrepreneurs may not invite clients to their homes for reasons of property safety. They may be concerned that if a thief sees the client's home, he might think that the home is also worth breaking into.

C)  Home-based entrepreneurs may not invite clients to their homes for reasons of convenience. They may fear that if a thief sees the client's home, he might think that the client is also worth breaking into.

D)  Home-based entrepreneurs may not invite clients to their homes for reasons of their property safety. They may be concerned that if a thief sees the client's home, he might think that the client is also worth breaking into.
B
Explanation:  The home-based entrepreneur can invite clients to their home for an interview or to discuss the product or service. This will allow the entrepreneur to get a better understanding of the needs of their clients and to determine if the business is a good fit for them. It is also a way to make the entrepreneur's business more personal and relatable to their clients. By inviting clients to their home, the entrepreneur can build a strong and personal relationship with them and be able to provide them with the best possible service or product.

Explanation: 
The most common reason for home-based entrepreneurs to avoid inviting clients to their home is the inconvenience.  It is always more convenient to meet a client at a neutral ground, such as the client's office or even Starbucks.  This way, you don't have to worry about being inconvenienced by clients who want to drop in for a cup of coffee or lunch.

An old man named Mr. Candido Filio was one of our regular customer at the restaurant. He was one of the most intelligent people I've ever known.
Every Sunday the Philippine Star Newspaper had a special page for word puzzles and among his peers  , Mr.Filio held the record for solving all the puzzles in less than five minutes. He encouraged me to solve them too, and for months and months, I did my best to beat him but failed.
Then one Sunday, I did it! I was able to complete them before anyone else. Everyone cheered for me. He came up to me with a smile and said,  "" No one has ever beaten me before. You are the first. I'll have a prize for you tomorrow.""
The next day, he gave me a special Scrabble set. I would have never been able to afford one like that by myself. Then he said to me,  "" Kate, what do you think is man's final goal in life? Happiness, isn't it? You are happy and that should be considered as a success. Many people spend a lifetime searching for that. Be thankful that you have found it."" I looked at him and knew that my life had changed, probably forever. He must have known that I always felt sad about not having much money.

Then, summer came and it was time to work harder than ever.  I continued working as a waitress at night, instructed tennis camps several mornings a week and worked as a secretary for a few hours in the afternoons. I even decided to take a class at a community  college. This class at the community college saved me $650. It was an extremely tiring summer and made me anxious to return to my relatively easy life at the university.
During my second and third years of undergraduate schooling, I decided to work about five hours per week in the campus   admissions office answering phones. This provided a little spending money and kept me from drawing my savings out. The overall situation looked hopeful as I approached my senior year as long as I could make as much money as I had the previous summer. I wanted to go to Israel to study for 3 weeks, but I hesitated in making this decision because it would cost me $1 600 more to get the credits in Israel. About two weeks later my Mom called to tell me that I had$1 600 in the bank that I had forgotten about! One of my concerns about this trip was not only the cost, but the loss of time to make money; however, I made as much that summer in the ten weeks when I was at home as I had made during the fourteen weeks when I was at home the summer before. The way everything worked together to make this trip possible was one of the most exciting things that have ever happened to me.
This experience has shaped me in many important ways. The first thing that I learned was the importance of a strong work ethic  .

972,,"Passage: Do you scream on a roller coaster ride? You slowly climb up a steep slope until an almost vertical  drop, and then... Ahhhhhhhh! Thrill-seekers like me are in luck because theme parks are pushing the boundaries of technology to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known.
Alton Towers in Britain opened the world's first 14-1oop roller coaster a few months ago, called The Smiler. Over in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest one. Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride sends out passengers from 0-240km/h in just 4. 9 seconds. During this rapid acceleration they experience G-forces only fighter pilots usually  feel: Up to 4. 8G. The designer of several rides at Alton Towers, said: ""While we can stand 6-8Gs for very short periods of  time, ff we experience 5G for more than five seconds we're likely to ""black out.""
On modern roller coasters passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops. But while we may have reached the limit in terms of G-forces, there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go---it's all down to money. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost ~18m to build.
Some companies are finding other ways to keep us amused. There's a move towards indoor rides where the experience is improved by audio-visual technologies. For example, a company called Dynamic Structures is currently developing a ""coal-mine-themed"" ride for a client in Dubai that will combine speed and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics, which will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling.

Explanation: The roller coasters are made to travel at a speed of 240 km/h, this is the maximum speed of the roller coaster. It is not the maximum speed of the roller coaster that is important but the maximum speed of the passengers. The Smiler is travelling at a speed of 240 km/h and the passengers are travelling at a speed of 240 km/h. This means that the passengers are travelling at a speed of 240 km/h.
