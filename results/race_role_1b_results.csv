","th 'The answer is: <A/B/C/D>'.\n\nYou may use the following information:\nCarbon dioxide is a gas that is released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned. It is a major greenhouse gas. The global average surface temperature has been increasing by about 0.7°C (1.3°F) per decade since the mid-19th century. This trend is likely due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports that emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased by about 40% since the pre-industrial era.\n\nThe IPCC reports that emissions of carbon dioxide are expected to rise by 4.3% per year from 2010 to 2050. The increase in emissions is projected to lead to a temperature rise of 0.3°C (0.5°F) by 2100, which would increase the likelihood of extreme weather events and increase the frequency and intensity of droughts and floods.\n\nThe IPCC reports that it is possible to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by planting more trees, but this option would take several decades to have an effect.
